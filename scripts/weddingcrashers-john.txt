August 1,2003 
INT. LAW FIRM OF BECKWITH AND KLEIN - DAY
A small Boston law firm. A few lawyers and clients mill
about. We zero in on one door with a plaque that reads "John
Beckwith." JOHN BECKWITH, an attorney, early thirties, is
sitting at his desk in a well appointed office talking on the
phone angrily.
JOHN
Oh bullshit! You saw the
surveillance videotape. Your
client's slip and 'fall was the
biggest acting job since I took
the stage in eighth grade as
Othello. And I blew!
(beat)
Never gonna happen. Maybe a
quarter of that. Maybe. 1'11 talk
to the insurer.
John's attention is captured by a hot secretary walking by.
JOHN
(continuing)
Great. Talk to your ciient.
(beat)
Yeah, next Friday. I got good
seats. Bring that girl, your
friend ... with the hair? Yeah. Okay.
John hangs up the phone and puts his feet up on the desk.
INT. LAW FIRM OF BECKWITH AND KLEIN - CONTINUOUS
JEREMY KLEIN, a Divorce lawyer, early 301s, sits at a desk
with a WOMAN, also in her thirties. His eyes wander to the
same hot secretary now walking by his office.
WOMAN
Eight years of marriage all shot
to hell.
JEREMY
(eyes following the
secretary's ass)
Had I known you eight years ago I
would have advised you to avoid
the wedding.
WOMAN
But I do believe in the
institution of marriage.
Jeremy's attention is jolted back to the woman. 
.- JEREMY
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Did you say the
"institution?" No, no. The Boston
Red Sox are an institution.
Pastrami on rye is an institution.
Yr. Rogers is an institution.
Marriage is a curse. Our
punishment for original sin.
The woman is taken aback.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Do you understand the ugliness I
see here every day? The sheer
torment? The absolute hell? Just
because people like you ... and God
bless your innocent heart, really
believe in the "institution" of
marriage!
WOMAN
My parents were happily married.
JEREMY
No. They really weren't. You think
they were. But they' really weren't.
WOMAN
They weren't?
Jeremy shakes his head.
WOMAN
(continuing: beat)
Mom did drink ...q uite a lot.
JEREMY
Of course she did. They all do.
(ushering the woman
out)
Don't worry, we'll go for the
jugular.
He shakes her hand and the woman exits. He sees John down the
hall and motions for him to come by. John enters and plops
down on the couch.
JOHN
So what's up?
Jeremy reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a bottle of
\. single malt scotch with a ribbon around it and hands it to John. 
.. JEREMY
Happy Anniversary.
JOHN
Huh?
JEREMY
Fifteen years, my friend!
John looks perplexed
JEREMY
(continuing)
June 11, 1988? Paul Revere High?
Junior Prom night?
JOHN
Ohhhh. Righ.t. Yeah. The night we
met.
JEREMY
Could yoc sound more underwhelmed?
JOHN
I'm not underwhelmed.
JEREMY
You took Barbara Rothstein to the
prom and wound up in the men's
room making out with another girl.
JOHN
And you were in the stall next to
me making. out with some chick who
was not your date. Who was your
date?
JEREMY
Mary Theresa Spinolli. Don't you
remember? Turned out she was
cheating on me! -
JOHN
Ohhh. That's right.
JEREMY
I knew that night that you and I
were cut from the same cloth. Best
friends forever.
(beat)
I can't believe you forgot.
JOHN
A lot on my mind. 
- JEREMY
You think it's gay, don't you? The
anniversary thing ... JOHN
I don't think it's gay.
JEREMY
Because you forgot on our tenth,
too. Remember I got you that beerof-the-month club thing?
JOHN
Yeah, that was great. The beer.
JEREMY
You thought it was gay.
JOHN
I didn't think it was gay, for
Christ's sake! It was beer!
JEREMY
Then how come you never get me
anything for our anniversary?
JOHN
Okay ... what you said right there?
That was a little gay.
JEREMY
Oh, fuck you. Anyway, we've got a
big three weeks ahead of us.
JOHN
Yeah. End of the wedding season.
How many weddings are we gonna
crash?
Jeremy looks at his daytimer.
JEREMY
I've got us down for eight.
JOHN
Any of them cash bars?
JEREMY
Two. But I got it covered.
(pulling out two
medals )
Purple hearts. We won't have buy
a drink all night. 
JOHN
Perfect.
JEREMY
Eight opportunities to get laid,
my friend. Eight opportunities to
score with women so aroused by the
thought of marriage they
mistakenly hook on to us as the
men of their dreams.
JOHN
Bingo. I'll get my tux.
Jeremy walks to his door and grabs a clothing bag. They exit.
EXT. TEMPLE BETH SHALOM/VESTIBULE - LATER
John and Jeremy, in tuxedos, enter the Synagogue and
introduce themselves to the ushers.
JOHN
Hi, Lou Epstein.
JEREMY
Chuck Schwartz.
They both put on their yarmulkes.
INT. SYNAGOGUE - A LITTLE LATER
The service is in full swing. The Rabbi is chanting. John
glances at a pretty young woman sitting down the aisle from
him. She's choked up. She looks at John and smiles. John
takes out a handkerchief and dabs a fake tear from his eye.
The woman takes a breath, she's smitten. It takes a real man
to cry at a wedding. CLOSE ON: John's hand. He's concealing
a small tube of "Bausch and Laumb Hypo Tears."
Jeremy makes eye contact with another woman. She returns the
eye contact. Jeremy smiles and turns away. She's not the one
He looks to his left and catches the gaze of a young blonde
woman. She briefly returns his glance and half-smiles. Jeremy
smiles. She's the one.
The Rabbi concludes, the Groom steps on the glass, the crowd
including our guys shout, "Maze1 Tov!"
INT. BALLROOM - LATER
The reception is in full swing. As a sort of hip ~lezmer band
plays, we see John and Jeremy practicing the fine art of
wedding crashing: 
John does a-magic trick for some kids.
Jeremy dances with the bridels.mother. She's blushing.
John slaps some old guy on the back as John shares with him
a disingenuous laugh.
Jeremy raises his glass to toast the happy couple.
John raises his glass to toast the happy couple.
Jeremy does magic tricks for the kids.
John dances with the bride's mother.
Jeremy dances with the second woman he made eye contactwith.
John dances slowly with the woman who saw him cry.
Jeremy, in a secluded alcove, is about to kiss the woman he
was dancing with.
John, in a secluded alcove, isabout to kiss the woman he was
dancing with.

INT. JEWISK- WEDDING RECEPTION
John and Jeremy are just beginning to dance to, the perennial
wedding reception song, "Shout!" The guests sing along. Close
on John and Jeremy as they sing and dance.
JOHN AND JEREMY
"It makes you want to shout! Put
your hands up and shout!"
JOHN AND JEREMY
(singing)
Fa-Lo querer shout! Ponha seus
bracos acima e shout! Ponha seus
pes acima e shout!
INT. CHINESE RECEPTION

(singing)
"Gee-fun-chee-na-to Snout ! Choyeng-to-uh-see-ho Shout! SM-i-nogong-a-to Shout!"
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
John and one of the women we've seen from a wedding jump into
bed as "Shout" continues to play.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Jeremy and one of the women we've seen from a wedding also
jump into bed as "Shout" keeps playing.
INT. VARIOUS BEDROOMS
We intercut between DIFFERENT WOMEN with John and Jeremy
jumping into bed. "Shout" still plays.
INT. VARIO'JS DANCE FLOORS, RECEPTIONS, AND BEDROOMS
The music gets louder and louder. A rapid sequence of dance
floors, receptions, winks, nods, kisses, toasts as the music
crescendos. When we hear the final "shout," the music stops
and we cut to John and Jeremy each rolling off of their
respective women. Jeremy sighs contentedly. John stares off
pensively: something's missing.
INT. JOHN'S OFFICE - DAY
;ohn is at his desk, working. Jeremy walks right in and sits
down, holding a newspaper. 
JEREMY.
Shn, I am holding the Kentucky
Derby of wedding announcements!
JOHN
I thought we were done for a while?
JEREMY
This is different. This is the'
Secretary of the fucking Treasury!!
JOHN
Cleary?
JEREMY
Yes, Cleary's . daughter ! Out .on the
Cape !
JOHN
(unenthusiastic)
Mrn hmm.
JEREMY
What's wrong with you?-This is the
Clearys!! They're an institution!
We've never crashed anything like
this! Five hundred single women.
Three live bands! Oysters!
JOHN
Okay. . .
Jeremy stares at him.
JEREMY
"Okay?!" See? This is what I'm
talking about!
JOHN
I'm tired, all right?! My feet
hurt. My voice is hoarse.
JEREMY
You don't care about this anymore!
JOHN
What are you talking about? Of
course I care!
JEREMY
At the Buckner nuptials, you were
in the corner, sulking! 
.- JOHN
I wasn't sulking! I twisted my
ankle.
JEREMY
Rule six: Don't sit in the corner
and sulk. It draws attention in a
negative way. Draw attention to
yourself on your own terms!
JOHN
I know the rules, Jeremy!
JEREMY
When Chazz Reinghold gave us those
sacred rules of wedding crashing
twelve years ago, he passed on a
legacy. We have a responsibility
here.
JOHN
You know, you make it sound like
a cult. Chazz Reinghold was a kook!
ZEREMY
Bite your tongue! He was not kook!
He was a brave and decent man!
JOHN
He lived with his mother until he
was forty! She tried to poison his
oatmeal! Even she couldn't take it!
JEREMY
That was never proven! And anyway,
what about Rule Three?! Rule Three
for Chrisnakes, John!
JOHN
Oh not that again--
JEREMY
Rule Three: Toast in the native
language if you know tne native
language and have practiced the
toast. Do not wing it! Last week
you when yKtoasted the groom in
Hindi--
JOHN
Ok! I got a couple of words mixed
up. Big deal! 
... JEREMY
A couple of words mixed up?! You
told the entire wedding party that
the bride was very lucky because
her new husband smelled like the
anus of the cobra!
JOHN
I meant. he had the power.. of
the...cobra! Okay?! ... anyway I
managed to turn that into a
compliment, did I not?!
JEREMY
Oh please ... So do you want to do
this or not?
JOHN
Give me the paper.
john grabs the paper from Jeremy and reads the announcement.
JOHN
(continuing; beat)
All right, well first of all, I'm
not saying it's impossible, but it
is going to require some planning.
JEREMY
There ' s my man. He's back. My man
is back!
EXT. CHURCH YARD - MORNING, A WEEK LATER
John and Jeremy are standing outside John's car in front of
a very nice old Catholic church on the Cape. They're in their
tuxes, both putting on their cufflinks, combing their hair,
etc. We see guests milling about in front of the church.
JOHN
Okay, let's do our pre-game,
JEREMY
What's to know? Big Catholic
wedding. Lots of rich fuckers. Hot
chicks. We can do this in our
sleep.
JOHN
Rule one: Always prepare.
JEREMY
Fine. What do you have?
John reaches in the car and hands him a folder 
- JOHN
A few articles on Secretary
Cleary's economic policy. Skim
them quickly. Also a roster of the
key family members. A glossary of
sailing terms. Sailing's like sex
to these 'people.
Jeremy looks over the folder.
JEREMY
(reading to himself)
Okay ... Harvard ... Kennedy School of
Government. ..Mom's big with the
charities blah blah blah. Three
daughters, one son, a million
foundations. Barf. Puke. Gag.
Okay. Got it. What1 s our back
story?
JOHN
We're brothers from New Hampshire.
We're venture capitalists.
JEREMY
I'm sick of that one. Why . don't we
be from. ..Vermont and..; and have,
say, an emerging maple syrup
conglomerate.
JOHN
Because we don't know anything
about maple syrup.
JEREMY
I know everything about maple
syrup. I love maple syrup.
JOHN
I love red vines. Doesn't mean we
should be the red vine barons,
riqht?
JEREMY
Good point.
EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - A MINUTE LATER
John and Jeremy walk toward the church confidently. They see
two men checking names as the guests enter the church. John
and Jeremy stop abour twenty feet from the cnurch. They see
men in suits with earpieces.
JOHN
I knew it! Secret Service. 
.- JEREMY
Yeah. So?
- JOHN
So they don't mess around. They're
trained to take bullets.
JEREMY
Big deal. I could take bullets.
JOHX
Oh, please. You .won't even get a
fiu shot. Maybe we should catch
that Portuguese wedding down in
New Bedford. They'll have those
sausages you like.
JEREMY
Fuck the sausages. We're hitting
this one. Everything we've done
for the last twelve years, all
tha: hard work, has lead us to
this moment.
JOHN
Fine. How do you want to get in?
JEREMY
Okay. Let me think.
(beat)
We'll do an end run!
JOHN
Guarded.
JEREMY . '
Shit!
(beat
Hey! We'il create a disturbance!
JOHN
Not with these guys. ~isturbances
just hype their radar.
JEREMY
Okay, then what do you got?
John looks to the parking lot behind Jeremy and sees a large
mini-van pull up. A BIG GROUP of people get out of the minivan. Probably some sort of extended family.
JOHN
Let's just rush in with this big
group. 
.- JEREMY
A rush?! You want to do a rush?
JOHN
Yeah, what's wrong with a rush?
JEREMY
It's amateur hour, buddy. It's
bush league. We're better than a
rush.
The big group walks toward the church.
JOHN
It'll work.
JEREMY
No. A rush is how you crash the
Journey concert when you're
thirteen. We're not gonna do a
rush. It's beneath us. We're
craftsmen.
A member of the big group points to a name on the list and
the big group starts to file into the church.
JOHN
GO !
John pushes Jeremy into the big group and they successfully
enter the church under their cover.
INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS
John and Seremy enter to find a'beautiful old church. John
notices an attractive WOMAN IN A BLUE DRESS talking to a
friend. They're pointing to various seats trying to make a
decision.
JOHN
(to the woman in the
blue dress)
Five rows back. Close enough to
the altar but far enough back to
see the bride's entrance.
The woman in the 'blue dress smiles at him.
JOHN
(continuing)
NOW, a lot of people go for the
aisle. That's a mistake. You have
that whole "should I make eye
contact with the bride" business.
(more) 
... JOHN (cont'd)
You don't want that. It's awkward.
Fifth row back, second seat in.
Trust me.
WOMAN IN T3E BLUE DRESS
That's great. Thank you so much.
She smiles at John and walks to the seat he recommended.
JOHN
I have to hit the head.
JEREMY
Okay. I'll get us some seats on
the groom's side.
Jeremy finds seats as John heads tc the bathroom.
EXT. CHURCH BATHROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
The GROOM is leaning against a urinal, hyper-ventilating and
dry-heaving before the service as John enters. J~hn has seen
this many times before. He stands at the next urinal.
JOHN
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
The groom startled, turns around.
JOHN
(continuing)
You're thinking, "What have I
done? I 'm over.. I 'm finished. Now
it ends." And at what? Twenty-six?
The groom nods.
JOHN
(continuing)
Twenty-six years of pure uncut
premium Grade-A sexual freedom.
Yeah, it's a drug. A drug that
makes morphine look like skittles,
and it's going right down the
toilet as you descend into the
abyss of country kitchens, dirty
diapers, mind-numbing conversation
about her "needs" and worse, the
same sex with the same person, day
after day, night after night, year
in, year out.
The groom starts retching again. 
... JOHN
(continuing)
Well, you're wrong. It's not like
that. You see it as the beginning
of the end. No, my friend! It's
the end of the beginning ...
The groom looks up, encouraged.
JOHN
(continuing)
You're about to enter a world so
complex and fulfilling, it makes
your old life of endless boozing,
late nights, and meaningless
pieces of ass seem like the
shallow depressing graveyard that
it really is.
The groom nods.
JOHN
(continuing)
A world rich with deep love,
adoration and appreciation from a
life partner ... well this kind of
happiness you never dreamed
possible. It's a mystery, a gift
that God gave us. And when the
kids come? They call you
Daddy ... and you're their hero. And
you end up growing old with
someone whose love for you is
timeless, endless. Someone who
knows what you're thinking before
you say it. Who'll take care of
you when you're sick, comfort you
when you're sad, laugh with you,
cry with you.
The groom takes a deep breath.
JOHN
(continuing)
Someone you never have to impress,
but always want to. Most men would
give up their left arm to be in
your shoes.
GROOM
(beat, he's better)
Thank you.. . 
.- JOHN
No problem.
(painting ta the door)
Now, go get 'em.
John watches the groom start to exit. But before re-entering
the church, the groom stops and turns around.
GROOM
Hey, how long have you been
married? . JOHN
oh ... I'm not married.
(beat)
I might try to nail that chick in
blue- dress; though. She seems nice.
The groom looks perplexed as John exits
INT. CHURCH - A MINUTE LATER
John kneels down next to Jeremy in the pew, who's pretending
to be in prayer. They both pretend to be in prayer as they
start scoping potential women. They sit back down.
JEREMY
(sotto)
Third row. Straw hat.
JOHN
(sotto)
You know that women who wear hats
never give it up. C'mon!
JEREMY
(a little too loud)
What? That's not true! 1 bagged
that hat chick at the Martingano
wedding !
People turn around. John smiles apologetically.
JOHN
A little louder. I don't think the
Priest heard you.
A COUPLE in their fifties sit down next to John. The man
reaches out his hand to John.
MAN
Frank Myers. 
... JOHN
(shaking his hand)
John Ryan. This is my brother
Jeremy.
Jeremy nods.
FRANK
So, how do you know the groom?
JOEH
Oh, we're.. . ' . (quick beat of
thinking)
Uncle Ned's kids.
FRANK
Uncle Ned? Is he Liz's brother?
JOHN
Yeah ... Liz's brother.
FRANK
Great. -How is everybcdy?
JOHX
Oh really. Dad's fine. Aunt Liz
sends her best. She couldn't make
it.
FRANK
Uh...I know. She's dead.
Jeremy leans over. He's had to do this before
JEREMY
She sends her best from the grave.
We've become very spizitual.
FRANK
I see....
Franks smiles and turns away.
JEREMY
(sotto to John)
How many times are you gonna do
this? If you're going to commit to
a relative, be sure make you know
whether they have a pulse.
The groom cones out unto the altar. The guests turn toward
the back of the church. John and Jeremy turn to see a
groomsmen escort a very old lady to her seat. 
This is MAR!i CLEARY, the grandmother of the bride and the
b- matriarch of the Cleary family. Next, two groomsmen walk the
mother of the -bride, KATHLEEN-CLEARY to her seat. She has the
glow of someone who has been drinking ... every day for the
last twenty-five years.
A cute FLOWER GIRL, about seven, walks up the aisle,.
concentrating hard on what she's supposed to be doing. She
takes two deliberate steps and them tosses some flower petals.
FLOWER GIRL
Step. Step. 'Throw. Step. Step.
Throw.
She continues to do this untilshe gets near the altar.
Noticing that she still has a lot of petals left, she empties
the rest of the flowers unto the floor and sits down in the
first aisle.
Next, groomsmen and bridesmaids start to walk down the aisle.
One of the bridesmaids is GLORIA CLEARY, the bride's youngest
slster. She's a~tractive in a sweet and wholesome sort of way
and Jeremy elbows John.
JEREMY
(sotto)
Hello.
(then to John)
Dibs.
JOHN
All yours, my friend.
A groomsman, SACK LODGE, walks-the maid of honor, CLAIRE
CLEARY, the bride's sister, down the aisle. She's very
attractive and John takes notice. When she gets to the altar,
a String Quartet plays "Here Comes the Bride." The guests
stand as the BRIDE is walked down the aisle by her father,
TREASURY SECRETARY WILLIAM CLEAR?.
John takes a look at the bride and turns to Jeremy.
JOHN
(continuing)
I think we've got a crier.
JEREMY
Nah.. .
JOHN
Twenty bucks?
JEREMY
You're on. 
The Secretary walks the bride to the altar and after giving
her a kiss on the cheek, sits down next to his wife. The
..- bride immediately starts bawling.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Jesus. . .
Jeremy reaches into his wallet and hands John a twenty.
INT. CHURCH - A LITTLE LATER
John and Jeremy are bored like crazy. The Priest, FATHER
O'NEIL, a grandfatherly sort, continues the service.
FATHER 0' NEIL
Now, for our next reading, I'd
like to invite the bride's sister,
Gloria, up to the lectern.
JOHK
(sotto to Jeremy)
Twenty bucks says it's First
Corinthians.
JEREMY
No way. Colossians. 3: 12.
Gloria walks up to the Lectern, opens the bible and starts
reading.
GLORIA
A reading from Paul's first letter
to the Carinthians.
Jeremy rolls his eyes. He reaches into his pocket and pulls
out another twenty and hands it to John.
GLORIA
(continuing; reading)
"Love i.s patient. Love is kind ..."
JEREMY
(sotto, mimicking)
Love is bullshit. Love sucks dick
INT. CHURCH - FORTY FIVE MINUTES LATER
Jeremy is dozing off in the pew. John elbows him. Jeremy
jolts awake and dabs some fake tears under his eyes.
JEREMY
(by rote)
I just love to see young people
happy. 
.- FATHER O'NEIL
Craig and Christina are both quite
the sailing enthusiasts. So it
came as no surprise to any of us
when Craig proposed to Christina
while sailing the Caribbean.
John and Jeremy look at each other and feign a dry-heave.
FATHER O'NEIL
(continuing) . . . .
Speaking on behalf of all of us, . ..
I think I can say confidently that
this marriage will be
[thinks this is
clever)
smooth sailing all the way. Now,
the bride and the groom have
elected to say vows that they
themselves have written.
The RING BEARER hands the Priest the pillow that carries the
rings.. The Priest hands a ring to the groom who places it on
the bride's finger. - -
GROOM
I Craig, take you Catherine to be
my wife, my best friend, and my
first mate.
Claire, the maid of honor, makes a face that says "Oh,
please." John notices this and smiles.
GROOM
(continuing)
To captain our ship of love and to
stay with that shlp co matter how
rough the seas.
Claire has t o s t i f l e laughter.
GROOM
(continuing)
Through health and sickness, clear
skies and squalls.
Claire lets out a little laugh. John can't take his eyes off
of her. In ten years of wedding crashing,--he has never seen
anyone in the bridal party laugh during the vows.
GROOM
(continuing)
You are the star I set my course
to. You are my magnetic north. My
sextant always point to you. 
Claire can!L fight it, she laughs. She coughs to cover her
laugh. The Bride looks crossly at her.
CLAIRE
Sorry. Tickle in my throat. Please
continue.
JEREMY
(to John)
Well, this is a first.
JOHN
(enamoured)
She's amazing ....
The bride places a ring on the groom's finger.
BRIDE
I Christina take you, Craig, to be
my hcsband, my best friend, and my
Captain .
Clalre's in agony, pinching herself LO keep from losing it.
BRIDE
(continuing)
To be your anchor and your sail,
your starboard and your port, your
bow and your stern.
Claire has to turn around. Her shoulders are heaving.
BRIDE
(continuing)
Your life, your love, your lady,
and the sea.
Still turned around, Claire snort-laughs.
FATHER O'NEIL
By the power vested in me the
Roman Catholic Church and by the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I
now pronounce you Husband and Wife.
(to the Groom)
You may now...
(a little reluctantly) ... kiss the first mate.
Claire explodes in laughter which is drowned out by the
guests' applause as the Bride and Groom walk down the aisle.
The groomsmen and bridesmaids file out after them. John
studies Claire the whole way down the aisle. He's enthralled.
Jeremy winks at Gloria who blushes. 
INT. CHATW BEACH CLUB - NOON, LATER THAT DAY
John and Jeremy walk through-an entrance area and into a
large banquet room. John's holding a gift. Off to the side is
a bar area and off to the other side is a deck with an ocean
view. Everything is decorated beautifully. There are opulent
platters of food. A SWING BAND id playing. It's like
something from Gatsby. A waiter comes by with a tray of
lobster canapes. They each take one. Then Jeremy takes
another. The waiter walks off. Jeremy looks around. He's in
heaven. Women and food.
JEREMY
Sweet, huh? What did I tell you?
JOHN
You said it would be sweet.
John sees Claire, the Maid of Honor arrive. He smiles.
JOHN
(continuing)
Get us seats near-- but not too
near-- the bridal party. I'll drop
the fake present.
JEREMY
Excellent. And if you see any crab
cakes, grab me some. Got to have
some crab cakes.
John walks off to find the gift table. Jeremy surveys the
room. He looks at the name cards on the plates and pulls out
several name cards from his coat pocket. He shuffles through
the cards and finds a style match. He takes two other cards
from the table.
JEREMY
( continuing; to
himself)
Sorry Mr. and Mrs. Burgess. I'm
sure we'll find you another lovely
table.
Jeremy places his fake cards down on the table. CLOSE ON: The
new NAME CARDS read "John Ryan" and "Jeremy Ryan."
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - A MINUTE LATER
John approaches the wedding present table and places the fake
g~ft down. CLAIRE walks up afid starts checking out the gifts.
She picks up a medium size box and gives it a little shake.
JOHN
Fondue set. 
Claire's net sure what he's talking about.
CLAIRE
Excuse me?
JOHN
The present you're holding. It's
a sterling silver fondue set.
He holds out his hand.
JOHN
(continuing)
John Ryan.
CLAIRE
Claire Cleary.
(re. present)
How do you know?
JOHN
Sort of a psychic.
CLAIRE
Really?
(picks up another one)
What's this one, then?
JOHN
Knife set. Very nice. German.
Claire picks up another.
JOHN
(continuing)
Cotton linens, Egyptian.
John quickly picks up a series of presents names all of them.
JOHN
(continuing)
Place setting. Candlesticks.
Crystal Stemware ... which they'll
never use by the way and, I have
to say, is bad karma.
She holds up a small box.
JOHN
(continuing3
Massage oils and a book on Tantra.
Probably from the wacky Aunt. 
.- CLAIRE
(looking at gift card)
Aunt Millie. Wow. You-definitely
have a gift.
JOHN
Yes. Unfortunately, my powers only
apply to useless consumer products.
CLAIRE
Weil, look, if one day, the police
need someone to find a missing
Belgian waffle maker, you're there.
John laughs. Claire's mom Kathleen approaches.
KATHLEEN
Claire, we need you 'for pictures.
(re. John)
Who's your friend?
CLAIZE
This is John Ryan.
JOHN
(to Claire)
You remembered my name. Very good.
CLAIRE
I have a gift.
She winks at him and walks away with Kathleen. Kathleenturns
around and winks at him too.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUBlBAR AREA - A FEW MINUTES LATER
John enters the bar area. Jeremy waiks up to him. He's eating.
JEREMY
You must try the bacon wrapped
scallops.
JOHN
Will do.
(noticing a woman
approaching)
Oh shit! Isn't that the chick you
picked up at the Byrne Wedding?
JEREMY
(sees the woman,
panics)
Quick hide me! 
.-. JOHN
Too late. We'll do number ten from
the playbook.
She walks up.
WOMAN
Shlomo?! I thought you were
renouncing your possessions and
moving to Nepal.
Jeremy looks at her, f.eigning confusion.
WOMAN
(continuing)
Shlomo? Don't you remember me?
JOHN
Oh, God, I'm sorry. You didn't
hear, I guess. Shlomo had a bad
accident. In the Eirnalayas.
Snerpas, pack mules. Oxygen
deprivation. He doesn't remember
anyone. Even me, his own brother.-
I'm just some nice man who helps
him out.
WOMAN
Oh, you poor dear.
' Jeremy looks at her and does fake sign language to John.
JOHN
(to the woman)
I'm afraid, he can't hear you.
Part of the accident. You here for
the Cleary Wedding?
WOMAN
Yes, but I have to leave. I've got
a flight to ad rid.
Out of her sight, Jeremy mouths "Thank God" tb John.
WOMAN
(continuing)
But I could hang out for a few
minures .
(stroking Jeremy's
arm)
On, poor Shlomo.
Jeremy does more fake sign language. 
.- JOHN
He wants me to take him to the
bathr~om.
(off more fake sign
language)
And he wants some crab cakes.
(to Jeremy, signing)
Okay, we'll go to the bathroom
first then we'll get the crab
cakes.
Jeremy signs angrily.
JOHN
(continuing; signing)
Fine. We'll get you the crab cakes
first.
(to the woman)
Please excuse us.
WOMAN
(handing John a card)
Here's my number if there's
anything 1 can do to help.
The woman walks away. Jeremy grabs the card.
JEREMY
Cool. In a couple of weeks I'll
have you call her for me.
Guaranteed score. Deaf-mute
amnesiac. They love that. I won't
even have to buy her dinner.
JOHN
Charming. So what angle are you
going to work here?
JEREMY
(looking around)
Uh.. .I'll think I start with a
public balloon animal display for
the kids and then, when that chick
draws near, do the man-haunted-bynoble-past.
JOHN
Excellent.
JEREMY
Y oU? 
.- JOHN
No brainer. I'm gonna work the Dad
.and themdance with the little
flower girl. Public policy minded
and good with kids.
JEREMY
Beaut if ul .
JOHN :
Let's do it. . .
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - A LITTLE LATER
Jeremy is making balloon animals for the kids. Presently,
he's making an elephant. He hands the finished elephant to a
kid. All the other kids are impressed. Jeremy looks around
for Gloria, the bzidesmaid he had "dibs" on at the ceremony.
She looking at him from the corner of the room.
JEREMY
Okay, who's next?
A BRATTY KID steps to the front of the crowd.
BRATTY KID
I want a bicycle.
JEREMY
A bike takes too many balloons.
Uncle Jeremy's a little out of
breath. How about a giraffe?
Giraffe's are cool.
The bratty kid gets right in Jeremy's face.
SRATTY KID
Make me a. bicycle.
IAT. CHATH.9M YEACH CLUB - A LITTLE LATER
John is dancing with the Flower Girl who's counting her steps.
FLOWER GIRL
One, two, three, step. One, two,
three, step.
JOHN
Teil you what. Why don't you just
step on my shoes and I'll show you
a few moves you can bust out on
your classmates. Would you like
that? 
.- FLOWER GIRL
Yes, please.
She steps on John's shoes and he moves the Flower Girl around
the floor like Gene Kelly. She's laughing and having the time
of her life. Claire notices John and smiles at him. John
smiles back and dips the Flower Girl, who's eating this up.
KATHLEZN CLEARY, the mother of the bride, steps in.
KATHLEEN
(to John)
Let's see how you do with someone
your own age.
She's twice his age.
JOHN'
I think I'm up to the challenge.
(to the Flower Girl)
Save me a dance later.
The Flower Girl smiles and walks away. John spins Kathleen
around the dance floor.
JOHN
( continuing)
So, how long have you and the
Secretary been married?
KATHLEEN
Oh, thirty years next April.
JOHN
Wow.
KATHLEEN
Yeah, and we were faithful for two
of them.
She grabs ,Johns ass. CLOSE ON: John's stunned expression.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - A LITTLE LATER
Jeremy hands an incredibly elaborate balloon bicycle to the
bratty kid. Gloria walks up and notices the balloon.
GLORIA
(to Jeremy)
You're good.
JEREMY
This is nothing. Yesterday I made
my grandma a new house. Real nice
one, too. With a pool. 
Gloria laughs.
GLORIA
Okay, then I'll take a sports car.
JEREMY
Or how about a dance instead?
GLORIA
That's what I really wanted.
Jeremy pulls Gloria out on the dance floor.
INT. CHATHAN BEACH CLUB - COPJTINUOUS
John is with Secretary Cleary.
SEC. CLEARY
You read my position paper on
market expansion in Micronesia?
JOHN
Of course. Read it whiie I was
sailing my boat to Bermuda.
SEC. CLEARY
Ah, a sailor. Good man. Hey, you
didn't happen to catch my speech
on the Paraguayan Debt and Money
Supply issue, did you?
JOHN
Are you kidding me? It was
brilliant. Now if only Congress
weren't so short-sighted.
Secretary Cleary is thrilled by John's praise.
SEC. CLEARY
Yes, yes! So short-sighted.
(puzting his arm
around John)
John, what do you say you and I
head out to the deck and light up
a couple of cigars?
JOHN
Nothing would make me happier, sir.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB - CONTINUOUS
Jeremy and Gloria are dancing to a slower song.
GLORiA
And you saved his life? 
- JEREMY
Yeah, some others weren't so
lucky. It still shakes me up to
talk about it.
GLORIA
I'm sorry.
JEREMY
(a little choked up)
It's okay. It's just ... we lost
some really good men.
Jeremy stops dancing and looks down, deep in thought.
JEREMY
(continuing; then)
If you'll excuse me. I think I
need to get some air.
(shaking her hand)
It was nice meeting you.
Jeremy walks off rowards the exit.
EXT. BEACH - A MINUTE LATER
Jeremy walks down toward the ocean.
GLORIA (0. S. )
Jeremy! Wait up.
Over Jeremy's shoulder, we see Gloria running to catch up to
him. Jeremy smiles to himself. He's got her.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB/DECK AREA - LATER
John and Sec. Cleary are out on the deck, smoking cigars, and
looking out at the ocean.
SEC. CLEARY
John, you seem like an ascute man.
JOHN
Thank you, sir.
SEC. CLEARY
Maybe you can help explain
something to me.
(nodding towards the
corner of the deck)
See that young man over there?
John looks to see a young man, about 22. He's an intense,
morose, artiste. 
He's plucking petals off a rose and tossing them into the
ocean, watching each petal intently as it falls. This is
Secretary Cleary's son, TODD.
SEC. CLEARY
(continuing)
That's my son, Todd.
(shaking his head)
Twenty-two years old. The whole
world in front of him. Every
advantage in life. Advantages I
never had. Well, that's not
exactly true. Be had the same
advantages I had, which is a hell
of a lot of advantages. So here's
my question: what does he have to
be so morose about?
I don't know sir. Maybe he hasn't
found anything to believe in yet.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh, he ~gy~ he believes in
(wich disdain)
art. But all I've seen-him do is
dribble his own blood on a canvas,
then smear it around with a stick.
Well, some people think that's art
SEC. CLEARY
it's crap. Whatever happened to . - public service, our obligation to
our fellow man?
(noticing a waiter,
he holds up his
glass)
Um, Franklin. My daiquiri's at
half mast.
FRANKLIN, the waiter, grabs the glass.
FRANKLIN
Right away, sir.
JOHN
I 'm sure he's, you know, just
finding his way.
SEC. CLEARY
And perhaps I should take it
easier on him?
JOHN
Perhaps. 
.- SEC. CLEARY
Yeah. Maybe your right.
TODD
(screaming out
towards the ocean)
Death! You are my bitch lover!
SEC. CLEARY
Good, Todd, that's good! You tell
that. . .mean. . .'ocean.
John nods and smiles at Cleary.
EXT. BEACE - LATER
Jeremy anb Gloria are siting in a deserted cove. She's
completely smitten.
GLORIA
And so you dove into the icy water
LO save him?
JEREMY
Yeah, well, I'm sure anyone would
do the same.
GLORIA
I've always wondered about this.
It's so amazing to me. Why would
a man risk his own life to save
the life of someone ne doesn't
even know?
JEREMY
Well, the great 19th century
philosopher Schopenhauer asked
that very question and this is how
he answered it. He said that at
that moment when a person sees
another in danger, there is a
breaking in of a metaphysical
awareness. You know what chat
awareness is?
GLORIA
(expectantly)
What?
JEREMY
That we are all one. That
separateness is an illusion. That
I am one with everyone
(more) 
.- JEREMY (cont7d)
The Prime Minister of England, my
great Uncle Harry, you, me, the .
fat kid on "What Is Happening. " We
are all one.
GLORIA
We are?
JEREMY
Yes.
(taking her hand)
My hand... is your hand.
(touching her cheek)
My cheek.. . is your cheek.
(touching her lips)
My lips.. .
GLORIA
Are my lips?
JERZMY
Yes.
She kisses him passionately.
EXT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB/DECK AREA - CONTINUOUS
John is still with Sec. Cleary. Claire walks up.
SEC. CLEARY
Claire, there's someone I want you
to meet. This is John Ryan.
CLAIRE
We've met. He's psychic.
SEC. CLEARY
Really? Well, maybe he can teil me
where my daiquiri is.
(shouting)
Franklin ! Oh, Franklin !
Sec. Cleary exits
CLAIRE
You're a big hit at this wedding.
JOHN
A lot of nice people here.
CLAIRE
Oh, they're full of shit. 
.- JOHN
Excuse me?
CLAIRE
The only reason ninety-percent of
these people are here is because
of my Dad. They're all suckling at
the power-teat.
JOHN
Yeah. Well, I'm here for the
crabcakes - and the power-teat. When
is the suckling, by the way? After
the first dance?
She laughs.
CLAIRE
I don't know. Everyone walking
around trying to act like they
care. It's awful. Plus the place
is rife with lawyers. A gazillion
lawyers.
JOHN
Not big on lawyers, huh?
CLAIRE
Kate 'em. I mean ... you're not one
are you?
JOHN
Oh God, no. But 3ust oot of
curiosity, what have you got
against lawyers?
CTAIRE
Lawyers are by nature liars. And
I hate liars.
We see a few people slap Sec. Cleary on the back and share a
laugh with him.
CLAIRE
(continuing)
See? Suckling.
john laughs. He's finding Claire completely adorable. 
... JOHN
Maybe, but I think most people
come to weddings, even this one,
because they want to believe
they're in the presence of true
love, that true love is possible.
Even the lawyers. And the sucklers
CLAIRE
True Love, huh? And what is "true
love," John Ryan?
JOHN
Well ... true love is your soul's
recognition of it's counterpoint
in another.
This obviously moves her, but she tries to wave it off.
CLAIRE
Well, that's a little grandiose
JOHN
Perhaps. So are you giving a toast?
CLAIRE
Yes! Normally I'm terrible at
these things, but I think this
one's pretty good.
She hands John a piece of paper. Re reads it over.
CLAIRE
(continuing)
I had to fight the urge to be
completely honest. What do you
think?
JOHN
I think the urge won.
CLAIRE
What are you talking about?!
JOHN
You can't say this.
CLAIRE
Why not? 
.- JOHN
(reading,
incredulously)
"I never thought my sister would
find someone who cared about what
people thought as much as she did.
Until I met Craig."
CLAIRE
What?! It's funny. Funny because
it's true. People like funny.
JOHN
No, see, the funny-because-it'strue bit only works if the truth
is a small thing like "Tim's a
little frugal" or "We all know
Jennifer likes to shop. Ha. Ha."
I mean, people are here for a
wedding, not to see Don Rickles at
the Sands. I'd give it a fifteen,
maybe a twency percent chance of
a laugh. Not worth it. See, people
want something from the heart.
CLAIRE
(a little perturbed)
Well I think people are gonna love
it.
JOHN . Nope, you're gonna get dead
silence. Crickets.
CLAIRE
You're wrong. I'm going to stick
with it.
JOHN
Fine. I'll be in the back of the
room waiting to tell you I told
you so.
INT. C'aTHAM BEACH CLUB/BANQUET ROOM - LATER
The BEST MAN finishing up his toast. 
.- BEST MAN.
But I think Bruce Springsteen said
it best wkenhe .-said, "Someday
baby, I don't know when, we're
gonna find that place where we
walk in the sun." And I just want
to say how happy I am that my best
friend and the woman he loves have
found that place. It's truly
inspiring to us all.
An audible "aww" comes from the guests. They clink their
glasses. John, standing in the back of room makes eye contact
with Claire. John makes the gag sign. Claire stands up,
CLAIRE
I never thought my sister would
find someone who cared about what
people thought as much as she did.
Until I met Craig.
Not a lsugh in the piace. In fact pe6ple are dismayed.
CLAIRE
(continuing)
As you all know both my sister and
Craig are lawyers at big firms in
New York. But that's not the only
thing they have in common. You
see, they both have the same
favorite color. Green.
(beat i
Uh ... like ... money? You know?
Again, not a laugh. The guests are starting to shift in their
seats.
CLAIRE
(continuing)
Look, I'm sorry. I'm not reeily
good at this sort of thing.
She looks to John, who points to his heart.
CLAIRE
(continuing)
But I will tell you this. I've
heard it said that true love is
the soul's recognition of it's
counterpoint in another. That's a
very rare thing in this world and
it's something to be valued. And
I'm just really happy that my
sister has found it. 
The guests.al1 say "aww." The bride starts to cry, rushes up
and hugs Claire. The guests applaud. Claire looks over at
John who motions for her to meet him in the bar.
EXT. BEACH - SIMULTANEOUS
Jeremy and Gloria are under a blanket. They've just had sex.
GLORIA
That's was so amazing.
JEREMY
Yeah, great. What do you say we
head back?
GLORIA
I always knew my first time would
be on the beach. I'm just so happy
it was you.
CLOSE ON: Jeremy. He gulps in fear.
JEREMY
Wait a minute. Pirst time?
She nods.
JEREMY
(continuing)
You were a virgin?
GLORIA
Mm-hrmn. Oh, Jeremy, we're gonna be
so happy together. I love you.
CLOSE ON: Jeremy. A look of total panic.
John and Claire meet in the bar.
CLAIRE
Thank you!
JOHN
Now you know never to doubt me.
CLAIRE
God, it was exhilarating. It was.. .
She leans in the hug John but before she can, SACK (one of
the groomsmen) rushes up to her. Sack, early thirties, is
great looking, Ivy League, rich, works for noble causes. The
guy every guy hates. 
.- SACK
Claire, you were awesome.
Sack and Claire kiss. John is dumbstruck.
CLAIRE
John, this i.s my boyfriend, Sack.
JOHN
(halfheartedly)
Nice to meet you.
SACK
(to Claire)
Let's dance.
CLAIRE
(to John)
It was great meeting you.
She shakes his hand.
JOHN
Yeah, you too.
John takes a big slug of his drink. Jeremy rushes up to him.
JEREMY
Dude, we've got t~ get out of
here. ASAP. I've got a stage five
clinger.
JOHN
I need more time.
JEREMY
You're not hearing me. She's a
stage five! A virgin clinger! I'll
start the car.
John is looking over at Claire and Sack.
JEREMY
(continuing; off
John's look at
Claire)
Give it up already. Her sister
told me she's got a boyfriend.
Tough luck. We all have our bad
days. I need us to leave right now!
Secretary Cleary approaches with Gloria and his wife
SEC. CLEARY
There you two are. 
... JEREMY
Actually ... we're about to leave.
It's been a lovely werldlng.
(to Gloria)
I'll call you. It's a promise.
SEC. CLEARY
(ignoring Jeremy, to
John)
Well, look, we always hate to see
the wedding end so we keep the
party going back at our little
place on the Vineyard. It's sort
of a Cleary family tradition.
And, well, since we've all taken
a shine to you, we'd love you to
be our guests for the weekend.
What do you say?
Gloria smiles hopefully. Kathleen Cleary does the same.
Claire and Sack approach the group. John looks at Claire.
JOHN
We'd 'love to.
JEREMY
What?! We 'don't nave any other
clothes !
SEC. CLEARY
Oh, we have everything you need
out on the island.
JEREEY
But I promised my Granny I'd take
her to the park.
GLORIA
And I'm sure daddy can hire
somebody to take your Granny to
the park.
SEC. CLEARY
Not a problem.
JOHN
Great! Done.
John smiles. Jeremy starts to say something and John steps on
his foot. Cleary slaps John on the back. 
EXT. YACHT --- THAT AFTERNOON
John, Jeremy and about fifteen others are on the Cleary
yacht, a large expanse of boat, sailing toward Martha's
Vineyard. John and Jeremy stand at the stern of the boat.
Gloria approaches the guys.
GLORIA
Jeremy, sweetie, I'm making
lemonade. Interested?
JEREMY
Sure, sure..ThatUd be great, honey.
She smiles and crosses away.
JEREMY
(continuing; sotto)
And could you put some heroin in
it? John, this is against the
rules! You've got a wedding and a
reception tc seal the deal.
Period. No overtime!
JOHN
Oh really? No overtime? Need I
remind you of the Chung wedding,
1997?
JEREMY . - P.11 right, look--
JOHN
We finished the reception. I'm
ready to go home. Next thing you
know, you're dragging me to watch
you and some chick play mah-jongg
with her grandmother thirty miles
away at a retirement home.
JEREMY
I needed to do that, all right?!
JOHN
You needed to do that ... ha.
JEREMY
She was into her grandma! You know
the drill!
John scoffs.
JEREMY
(continuing; loudly)
It was my first Asian! 
I
L The people.an the boat turn around and look at Jeremy. John
shoots him a look.
JOHN
Look, I just need some alone time
with her.
JEREMY
She's got a boyfriend.
JOHN. . .
They all have boyfriends. So what?
JEREMY
Okay. Fine. Get some alone time,
seal the deal and let's get the
fuck away from these people.
Sack walks over to them.
SACK
Gentlemen. Everything okay?
JOHN
Oh yeah. Fine.
Sack looks overboard.
SACK
Oh man, will you check that out.
A school of bluefish.
John and Jeremy lean over to take a look.
SACK
(continuing)
You know, these waters use to be
flush with bluefish. And then the
corporate polluters came in and
well, you can guess the rest.
After we, and I mean the National
Environmental Defense League under
my stewardship, got Massachusetts
to pass the Bluefish Revival Act--
JOHN
Bluefish Revival Act? They were at
Woodstock, right?
Sack laughs insincerely. William Cleary ambles over,
in hand, and quickly looks overboard.
cocktail 
.- SEC. CLEARY
My God! Are those bluefish?
(then)
You know, Sack here is singlehandedly responsible for the spurt
in the bluefish population.
Jeremy's ajout to crack wise-ass but John elbows him.
JOHN
Yes we heard.
SEC. CLEARY
Well, anyway, listen, as soon as
we get to the compound we were
thinking about a little touch
footballgame. Sort of a Cleary
family tradition. What do you say?
JOHN
Absolutely.
JEREMY
Great.
SEC. CLEARY
Good !
(examines his glass)
Camn, my daiquiri's at low-tide.
(looks overboard)
God, I love those bluefish.
Jeremy looks overboard. Cleary gives Jeremy a hard but
friendly slap on the back and Jeremy falls into the ocean.
EXT. YACHT - A LITTLE LATER
Jeremy is wet and shivering on the deck. As the boat
approaches land, John and Jeremy can see the Cleary family
compound on Martha's Vineyard. It's a huge, old beachfront
mansion with a large lawn and adirondack chairs strewn about.
There's also a doc^, housing various sailboats..
JEREMY
(sotto to John)
That's the "little place back on
the Vineyard?"
EXT. CLEARY FAMILY COMPOUND - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
Jeremy and John line up in a scrimmage with otner guests
including Claire, Cleary, and Sack. Todd, Claire's younger
brother sits in a lawnchair on the sideline reading. 
John hikes.the ball to Jeremy and goes out for a pass. He's
being covered by Sack. John fakes like he's doing an "out"
pattern but goes long. Sack is completely fooled. John
catches the pass from Jeremy for a touchdown. John is
congratulated by his teammates. Sack fumes.
EXT. CLEARY FAMILY COMPOUND - A FEW MINUTES LATER
John hikes the ball to Jeremy. Sack rushes in, aiming for
John. He misses him and completely flattens Jeremy who
manages to get the pass off.
ANGLE ON: John racing downfield. He reaches out to catch the
pass, however Claire intercepts. She does a little pivot
dance to get around John. John mimics her wildly. She laughs.
He touch/tags her.
CLAIRE
Not fair! You made me laugh!
JOHN
No, it's not fair. Yet a lot of
things in life aren't fair.
He mimics her again. She laughs and looks upfield.
CLAIRE
Hey, is your friend okay?
ANGLE ON: A few people are dragging Jeremy's seemingly
lifeless body off the field. John runs over.
SACK
I don't know what got into me.
SEC. CLEARY
I do! Five generations of Lodge
family breeding. Hell, your father
used to pull the same stunt when
we were your age.
Sack and Cleary share a laugh. John rushes over to Jeremy
JOHN
Are you all right?
SEC. CLEARY
Oh he's fine! Hey, Jeremy, why
don't you sit out the next play.
Todd, come on in.
Todd looks up from his book.
TODD
You must be joking. 
.- SEC. CLEARY
It wouldn't kill you to play some
competitive sports once in a
while, would it?
Todd scoffs. Cleary rolls his eyes.
JEREMY
(grabbing his side)
It's ok. It's ok. Um, perhaps Todd
could donate a kidney instead. . . * .. . .
. ..,
Gloria rushes over, hyper-concerned. She leans over him and
sticks her tongue half way down his throat. Jeremy jumps up
to get away from her.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Good, good. I'm better now. Second
down.
EXT. CLEARY FAXILY COMPOUND - A MINUTE LATEK
Different scrimmage. John is the quarterback. Jeremy hikes it
to him as Sack comes in to rush. John whips the ball quickly
to Jeremy who is pummeled and flattened by Sack.
SACK
Damn! What in the world is wrong
with me?!
SEC. CLEARY
Nature versus nurture, Lodge.
Nature always wins.
They share another overly-exaggerated manly chortle
SEC. CLZARY
[continuing)
Let's take a daiquiri time-out.
John walks over to Jeremy.
JOHN
You all right?
JEREMY
Um ... I may need you to perform the
Heimlich maneuver. I think I'm
choking on my own nuts. Do we get
to leave now?
JOHN
No. 
Gloria rushes over with her mother, Kathleen. i
L
KATHLEEN
Honey, let's take him in the house
and get him flxed up.
GLORIA
Sure, Mom.
Glcria helps Jeremy up who is practically concussive. They
hobble into the house, leaving John alone with Kathleen.
KATHLEEN
(to John)
It's so hot out. Why don't you
play in your underwear?
She gives him a long, flirtatious look.
JOHN
Umrn. . .
KATHLEEN
Think about it. I'll make you' a
drink.
John stares at her perplexed as she walks off.
INT. CLEARY BATHROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
JeremyiS sitting on the edge of the tub in serious pain as
Gloria applies mecurichrome to his wounds.
JEREMY
Ah man! That stings!
GLORIA
Ohhh, poor baby. Want me to
blow...on it?
JEREMY
It's fine.
She gets on his lap. RANDOLPH, the early 40's Jamaican butler
passes by the open bathroom door. They don't see him.
GLORIA
You know, I'm not wearing panties.
Randolph's shocked. He ciears his throat. They look up.
Gloria jumps off Jeremy's lap. Randolph speaks with a thick
Jamaican accent. 
.- RANDOLPH
Oh, don't worry, little Gloria.
Mum's the word.
GLORIA
Thank you, Randolph.
RANDOLPH
A little more discreet though,
okay?
Randolph shuts the door, shakes his head and walks away.
JEREMY
Oh Jesus ...
GLORIA
Don't worry. Be won't say
anything. Now where were we? Oh
right, I'm not wearing panties.
She starts to straddle him again.
JEREMY
It's like eight hours ago you were
a shy virgin. Now you're not
wearing panties?
GLORIA
(purring)
You do that to me.
She starts kissing him. He moves her off his lap.
JEREMY
Gloria, look, I'm tired. It's been
a long day. Not to mention that
your sister's boyfriend made a
smoothy with my nards. I'm not
exactly in the mood.
GLORIA
(pissed off)
Fine.
She takes a swab of mecurichrome and stabs his wound.
JEREMY
Aaaaaarrrrrrrrgh!
GLORIA
My Father warned me about people
like you! I'm just another notch
on your belt! 
.- JEREMY
No, no, it's not like that!
GLORXA
What's it like then, Jeremy?!
Huh?! Huh?!
JEREMY
It's like. ..
She takes another load of medicine and tortures another wound.
JEREMY
(continuing).
Aaaaaaaarrrrrrgh!
(gui.ckly)
Ok, ok. It's like you're so, uh,
damn precious that I would ... uh...feel like ... uh...I1m using
you if we took every opportunity
to express our...love ... in a
physical way. It diminishes the
poetry of this thing that we have.
She melts into his arms.
GLORIA
You're my knight. in shining armor.
JEREMY
Cool. Good. Good.
GLORIA
Don't ever leave me.
JEREMY
Oh no. Never. Don't you worry...
GLORIA
Good.
(beat)
Because I'll find you.
They get up. Jeremy's stressed. They exit into the hallway.
INT. CLEARY HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Jeremy and Gloria pass Sec. Cleary.
SEC. CLEARY
Get him all patched up, Glory-bug?
GLORIA
I sure did, Daddy. 
.. SEC. CLEARY
Well, you go change for dinner.
She gives Jeremy a peck on the cheek and walks away.
SEC. CLEARY
(continuing)
You really seem to make her happy,
son.
JEREMY
Oh well. . .yeah.
SEC. CLEARY
Hell, she's my youngest and I
spoil her a bit. I can only hope
you treat her honorably. You know,
sheTs not jcst another notch on
the 01' belt.
JEREMY
Oh no, no. Of course not, sir.
SEC. CLEARY
Good, good. Because that would
make me angry in ways you cannot
possibly imagine.
(beat)
And I'm a very powerful man.
JEREMY
Right. . .yes, sir.
SEC. CLEARY
Yeah. . .
(pondering)
Boy, I wish to Christ we could get
her off that mood medication. Oh
well, see you downstairs for
dinner.
Cleary walks away. Jeremy is now horrified.
INT. CLEARY FmILY DINING ROOM - LATER
An opulent dinner for fifteen is in the process of being
served. Cleary is at the head of the table. His mother
GRANDMA MARY, a woman who looks nearly 100, sits next to him.
The rest of the family, Sack, and the other guests fill out
the table. Randolph, the Jamaican butler, stands nearby.
John and Jeremy enter the alcove just outside the dining
room. John looks at Sack. He's holding court. John's
nauseated. 
.- JOHfi
(intense but sotto)
Jer, you have the visine?
JEREMY
No! Not the visine! It's too early!
JOHN
I need the visine, goddamit. Give
it to me!
JEREMY
You know the rules. The visine is
a last resort. The visine's a
fucking felony.
JOHN
I can't get any alone time with
her. The guy won't leave her side.
I need the visine.
JZREMY
The visine's fucking hard-core. A
few drops in his dfink and he'll
spend the next twenty-four hours
going down on a toilet seat,
puking his guts out.
ANGLE ON: Sack at the dinner table.
SACK
... so when I picked up the little
sea otter and wiped the oil off
him from the tanker spill, I swear
he...smiled . It was a little ... otter smile. You know, all teeth,'
the whiskers kind of pert ...
ANGLE ON: Jeremy and John. Jeremy' reaches into his pocket.
JEREMY
Okay, here's the visine.
John and Jeremy enter the dining room.
SEC. CLEARY
Here they are!
They sit down near the head of the table. Gloria has saved a
seat for Jeremy right next to her.
FATHER 0' NEIL
Heavenly Father... 
Everyone bows their heads. John quickly squirts the visine
into Sack's wine.
FATHER 0' NEIL
(continuing)
We thank you for the bounty on
this table and ask you bless our
family and friends here assembled.
In the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen.
They all make the sign of the cross. Jeremy, preoccupied,
doesn't until John nudges him. Randolph walks over with a
platter and sets it on the table.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh, these scallops look fantastic.
SACK
I brought them from an organic
scallop farm right off Nauggesett.
CLAIRE
(proudly f
Yeah, Sack talked the Governor
into subsidizing part of the
project.
SACK
Yup. Now, it's the state's only
self-sustaining scallop farm.
JOHN
Say that five times fast.
Ciaire laughs, then stops herself
JEREMY
(pointedly to Sack)
I bet they're tasty. Maybe I'll
try them when my jaw heals.
SACK
Again, I'm sorry, Jeremy. It's
that damn competitive streak. I'm
seeing a Buddhist about it.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh, not just any Buddhist. His
Holiness the Dalai Lama. He's a
friend. 
.- JEREMY
Really? I'm seeing a orthopedist
when get .back to -town. ~.ot just
any orthopedist. Dr. Epstein--
JOHN
(sotto, to Jeremy)
Enough, ok?
(to Sack)
He's just foolim around. So how
long have you and Claire been
together, Sack.
SACK
Uh...I don't know. What's it been,
Claire? A couple of years?
CLAIRE
Three and a half.
(to John and Jeremy)
We started dating while we were
doing that Habitat for Humanity
thing.
Sack smiles.
SACK
Anyway, John, tell me how you're
connected to the family again?
JOHN
Uncle Ned's kids.
JEREMY
You know...Uncle Ned? The brother
of.... Aunt Liz?
John and Jeremy bow their heads and make the sign of the
cross.
SACK
(suspicious)
Uh-huh. . .
We see Gloria reach her hand under the table and grab
Jeremy's crotch. Jeremy's eyes bug out. He tries to push her
arm away. Gloria, her an hidden by the table cloth, begins
to furiously masturbate Jeremy.
SEC. CLEARY
So John and his brother here are
venture capitaiists. 
- JEREMY
(falsetto)
That ' s right!
John looks at him strangely, then looks down. He sees what's
happening and gives Jeremy a shocked look.
SEC. CLEARY
That ' s great.. The venture
capitalist. The backbone of the
system. The. new pioneer.
CLAIRE
So is it just about money?
Sack feigns disgust.
JOHN
Oh ... no, no! Not at all. It's
about, you know, investing in
projects that are both ethically
and morally defensible.
SACK
Like what, for example?
JOHN
(making this up as he
goes along)
Like what? Oh, you know, we've got
company that, uh, takes the wool
from sheep and uh, arrd turns it
into thread for the homeless
people to sew ... into .cloth and
then make, you know shirts and
pants to sell at a profit.
Everybody wins.
CLAIRE
Cool. . .
SACK
Mmm. What's it called?
Jeremy is near climax.
JEREMY
(falsetto)
Holy sh--
JOHN
{quickly)
Holy Shirts And Pants. 
The group mas approvingly.. ~1ear~'s wife Kathleen looks at
John and licks her lips seductivery. John's horrified. Sack
reaches down .and feels his stoniach. Something' s--wrong.
SACK
I don't feel so good.
SEC. CLEARY
(ignoring Sack)
That's a hell of a good project.
Let me mention something to the
Commerce secretary.
JOHN
Great, great.
GRANDMA PIARY
Isn't my Willy doing a wonderful
job there in Washington?
JOHN
Oh yes, Ma'am.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh Mommy. ..
KATHLEEN
(sarcastically)
He still calls his mother "Mommy."
Isn't that cute?
Kathleen slams down her wine and pours another. Gloria is
finished with Jeremy. She giggles. Jeremy is spent.
GRANDMA MARY
The President is so proud of my
Willy.
GLORIA
(sotto, to Jeremy)
I'm so proud of your willy.
Jeremy, shocked, takes a drink of water.
GRANDMA MARY
You know, !@illy's predecessor was
a Jew.
Jeremy spits up his water.
SEC. CLEARY
Mommy, let's not go there. Saui
Rothstein was a good man. 
... GRANDMA MARY
Maybe so.
(beat)
For a Jew.
CLAIRE
Grandma, you can't talk that way.
You can't feel that way. It's not
right !
SEC. CLEARY
(to the table)
Mommy's a little old-fashioned.
JERENY
(sotto, to John)
Yeah. Like Hitler.
GRANDMA MARY
What did you say his name was
again, Willy? Hymie Bergstein? I
zlways forget his name. Buy my
Sod, did he have a nose on him.
Jeremy's aghast. It's like he's eating with the Gestapo.
CLAIRE
Grandma !
Well,
flip
GRANDMA MARY
, you could have used it to
pancakes. It was like a
spatula. I mean you could write
the Ten Commandments on each side
of that thing.
JOHN
(to Grandma Wary)
Ma'am, I have to tell you I happen
to have a lot of very good friends
who are Jewish. As does my brother.
JEREMY
Very close to the Jews.
GRANDMA MARY
(how dare you? ! )
Really?
JOHN
Yes. Really. 
.- CLAIRE
(to John)
Thank you. Finally someone speaks
UP.
SEC. CLEARY
Of course. We all have Jewish
friends! Nothing wrong with that
GRANDMA MARY
'Well I guess you have to now,
especially if you're doing
anything in finance. They own all
of that. Can somebody bring me'
another sherry?
Randolph Fours her another sherry. She downs it while holding
onto the butler's sleeve. She makes him pour another.
Sack grabs his stomach. He's turning green.
SACK
~'ve gotta go.
He stands up.
CLAIRE
What's wrong, honey?
SACK '' Gotta.. .go.
Sack bolts from the table.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh dear. Hope he's okay ...
JOHN
Well, there's a lot of flu going
around.
JEREMY
9ut his eyes are sure clear.
John elbows Jeremy. John passes a platter to Todd.
TODD
Oh, I don't eat meat or fish
GRANDMA MARY
(beat, sweetly)
Hel.s a homo.
CLAIRE
Grandma ! 
.- GRANDMA MARY
What? He can't help it. They say
it's genetic.
(indicating Kathleen)
From her side of the family.
Todd's head sinks. Jeremy gives him a sympathetic pat on the
arm. Todd looks at Jeremy ... lovingly.
CLAIRE '
(changing :.topic)
Todd's an amazing painter. He's
going to the Rhode Island School
of Design.
JOHN
Wow. That's very impressive.
TODD
Dad used to think I was a
political liability, you know, in
case he ever ran for President.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh Todd.
(to John)
Well, actually, truth be told,
polling shows a majority of the
American people would ultimately
empathize with our situation.
TODD
What is "our situation," Dad?!
GRANDMA MARY
You' re a homo.
KATHLEEK
Oh, for Chrissakes, William. Put
Mommy to bed already!
SEC. CLEARY
Okay. Mommy, we've had a iong day.
Cleary motions over Randolph, who helps Grandma Mary up.
GRANDMA MARY
I can do it myself, asshole.
Grandma Mary, clearly drunk, shuffles off. Todd, pissed off,
gets up and storms off.
TODD
I'll be in my room.
Painting ... homo things. 
KATHLEEN ~.
.-
You go right ahead, Toddy
JOHN,
(to Claire)
So maybe after dinner we could
take a walk?
CLAIRE
How about now? I can't take this
anymore. They're driving me crazy.
JOHN
Great! Let me just change my shoes
CLAIRE
1'11 be outside waiting. Hurry up.
JOHN
Absolutely.
Claire gets up and hastily exits. John looks at Jeremy and
winks. He gets up and exits in the opposite direction.
INT. GUEST ROOM - A MINUTE LATER
John is sitting on the bed putting on some top-siders. We
hear the door open and then shut. John looks up. We see
Kathleen Cleary. She's topless. John gasps.
KATHLEEN
I just got my tits done.
JOHN
(jaw agape) Uh-huh.
KATHLEEN
Do you like them?
JOHN
Uh, yes. Those ... are great ... tits.
KATHLEEN
William doesn't appreciate my tits.
JOHN
Well, darn him. Mrs. Cleary, I
don't think--
KATHLEEN
Call me Kat.
JOHN
Okay, Kat, I don't think that-- 
.- KATHLEEN
Call me Kitty-Kat.
JOHN
Uh, look ... Kitty-Kat ... I really
don't think this is appropriate--
She walks toward John and stands right over him.
KATHLEEN
Feel thein.
JOHN
What? !
KATHLEEN
I said feel them.
JOHN
Mrs. Cleary--
KATHLEEN
Kitty-Kat.
JOHN
Kitty-Kat, are you out of your
fucking mind?
KATHLEEN
I'm not letting you out of this
room until you feel them.
John sighs. He reluctantly reaches up and feels her breasts.
JOHN
They're very nice. Okay?
She moans deeply. She grabs her blouse and buttons it up.
KATHLEEN
We will be lovers before this
weekend isup.
She blows him a kiss and exits. John shakes his head; what
the hell just happened?
INT. HALLWAY - A MINUTE LATER
John is walking down the hallway. He passes Todd's room.
Todd's painting. He sees John.
TODD (O.S.)
Mom make you feel her tits?
John stops and backs up. 
.- JOHN
What?! No!
TODD
It's okay. I can tell. You have
that "Mom made me feel her titsn
look on your face. Don't worry
about it. She usually picks one
male guest a weekend to sexually
harass.
JOHN
Oh Jesus. . .
TODD
Don't say anything to Dad, though..
Sone friend of my sister said
something to Dad a couple of years
ago and he now lives in Paraguay.
And not by choice.
JOHN
Good to know.
TODD
No problem ...
John hurriedly continues down the hall. He runs into Seremy,
shuffling down the hall looking completely spent.
JEREMY
What's wrong?
JOHN
Nothing. I'm just trying to get
outside to meet Claire.
JEREMY
You've got a weird look on your
face.
JOHN
(through gritted
teeth)
Ciaire's Mom made me grope her
boobies, okay? !
JEREMY
Hmm. She get them done? They look
pretry good.
John stares at him a beat
JOHN
What's wrong with you? 
Sohn continues on down the hall.
JEREMY
What? I just asked--
JOHN
Shut up!
JEREMY
(calling out to him)
You go enjoy yourself! I'm just
gonna go spit up some blood and
ice down my balls.
Jeremy enters his room.
INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jeremy enters his guest room. Immediately he sees Grandma
Mary sleeping in his bed. He thinks he's walked into the
wrong room, but notices his cumberbund and jacket hanging
over the chair. He goes over to the bed and gently nudges
Grandma. She looks at him and screams. Jeremy screains.
GRANDMA MARY
What do you want?
JEREMY
You're in my room.
GRANDMA MARY
Oh dear. I am. Too much sherry.
Can you carry me to my room?
JEREMY
What?
GRANDMA MARY
I think I'm too drunk to walk.
JEREMY
Uh, okay, sure.
EXT, CLEARY FAMILY COMPOUND - SIMULTANEOUS
John steps outside' to meet Claire.
CLAIRE

JOHN
I'm sorry. I got

held up. 
.-. CLAIRE
Strange family, huh?
JOHN
Yeah... a little.
(beat )
So where should we go?
Sec. Cleary pokes his head out the door.
s EC'. , 'CLEARY
Claire, Sack was. asking for you.
Claire looks at John
CLAIRE
(to Sec. Cleary)
Could you tell him I'm busy?
SEC. CLEARY
He's in pretty bad shape.
C-GI RE
-(grudgingly)
All right ... I'm coming.
Cleary nods and goes back into the house
CLAIRE
(continuing)
Sorry, John. Maybe we can find
time tomorrow.
JOHN
Yeah, sure, tomorrow then.
Claire starts to head back into the house.
JOHN
(continuing)
Hey, help him get better soon. .. I
saw some otters earlier and they
were. . . frowning.
CLAIRE
(smiling)
Be nice.
Claire exits into the house. Cleary pokes his head back out.
SEC. CLEARY
John, my boy. Brandies? Den?
JOHN
Yeah. Great. I.'11 be right in. 
John looks-up at the sky, frustrated by his missed "walk with
Claire" opportunity.
JOHN
(continuing)
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
EXT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS
Jeremy's carrying Grandma down the hall.
GRANDMA MARY
You're very strong.
She giggles, than falls asleep. We see Randolph poke his head
out of his room, and obviously misinterpret what's going on.
JEREMY
(to Randolph)
Oh, uh, okay.. . .I know this looks
kind of strange--
RANDOLPH
You're bangin? the daughter and.
the grandma? ! How much jam you
got, mon?
JEREMY
No no! It's not like that!
RANDOLPH
Listen, mon. The family dog lives
downstairs. I can wake- him-up for
you, too, if you like.
JEREMY
Look, you've got it totally wrong!
RANDOLPH
Just be gentle wit her, mon. Okay?
She be pushing ninety.
Randolph returns to his room. Jeremy stands there dumbfounded.
INT. RANDOLPH'S ROOM - CONTINOUS
Randolph shakes his head, lights a bong and takes a monster
hit.
RANDOLPH

INT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
CLOSE ON: Jeremy. He's asleep. We see two legs straddle him.
He awakens with a jolt.
JEREMY
Hey!
Pull back to reveal Gloria. She starts tying his right arm to
the bed post.
JEREMY
(continuing)
What are you doing?!
GLORIA
Listen, I know what you were
saying before and I started
thinking that maybe I'm not being
exciting and adventurous for you.
She ties his other arm to the bed post.
JEREMY
Gloria--
GLORIA
Sssh. You'll wake everybody.

I'm going to make all your
fantasies come true.
JEREMY

INT. JERZMY'S BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

from our of frame and gently stroke his forehead. Jeremy
slowly awakens.
JEREMY
(half-asleep)
Gloria ...y ou have to go back to
your room.
TODD (O.S.)
It's not Gloria. 
Jeremy gasps. We pull back to reveal Todd, naked, on his
stomach stroking Jeremy's forehead.
JEREMY
Jesus Christ!
TODD
We had a moment at the dinner
table, didn't we?
JEREMY
What are you talking about?! There
was no moment.
TODD
Oh yeah, we had moment.
JEREMY
I was sitting right there. I think
I would have noticed a moment--
TODD
I made you a painting.
Todd picks up a flashlight and shines it on a painting
resting on Jeremy's dresser. We see a surreal red mess
blotched onto the the canvas.
TODD
(continuing)
I call it "Tortured Scrotum." It's
sexual and violent. Sort of a selfportrait. I thought you'd like it.
JEREMY
Oh wow ... that's, uh, something.
Thank you ... so ... much.
TODD
Oh you're more than welcome.
Todd kisses Jeremy on the forehead.
JEREMY
Say listen, Todd, I haven't gotten
much gosh-darned sleep tonight and
hey, why don't we talk tomorrow?
TODD
Promlse you'll make time for me?
JEREMY
Oh...cross my heart. 
.-. TODD
Okay ...y ou sleep.
Todd gets up, kisses his finger and puts it on Jeremy's lips.
JEREMY
Okay. Good enough.
Todd smiles and exits. Jeremy, shaken, looks upward.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Lord! How much more of this can I
take?!
INT. CLEARY FAMILY KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING
John is at the breakfast table, eating some bacon, reading
the newspaper, drinking coffee in a gargantuan kitchen.
Jeremy stumbles, exhausted, into the kitchen. A COOK is
making all kinds of breakfast things. He pours Jeremy some
coffee and exits.
JOHN
You know they'll make you anything
you want here? Waffles, bacon,
what ever. . . .
JEREMY
Oh that's swell, John.
JOHN
What's your probiem?
JEREMY
What's my problem? Oh, I didn't
sleep too well.
JOHN
Why not?
JEREMY
Well, besides the bone-crushing
pain and the midnight rape, there
wss a nude gay art show at 4 a.m.
JOHN
( ignoring Jeremy,
reading paper)
Phew. Red Sox are taking it in the
shorts.
Jeremy pulls the newspaper down. 
.- JEREMY
I'm taking it in the shorts!
JOHN
Have some toast
JEREMY
I'm too traumatized for toast! . .
Nonetheless, he grabs a piece off John's plate.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Look, I'm going to say this as
nicely as possible: if we don't
get the fuck out of here right now
I'm going to kill you.
JOHN
Can't do it.
JEREMY
Why not?!
JOHN
I need another day
JEREMY
(loudly)
For what?! She's got a boyfriend.
Plus, her own mental hospital here
to entertain him!
JOHN
Sssh! Keep it down! f think
Claire's into me. Plus, the
boyfriend's a complete tool.
JEREMY
Okay, we think the boyfriend's a
.tool. Maybe the whole world thinks
the boyfriends a tool. But if
she's doesn't think the
boyfriend's a tool then the game's
over.
JOHN
The game's never over.
JEREMY
John, the rules are really clear
about boyfriends and-- 
.- JOHN
Will you stop it with the rules,
already?! Fuck the rules!
JEREMY
(hurt)
"Fuck the rules?" How can you say
that?! You're a very insensitive
man.
JOHN
This isn't about the rules, okay?!
This is about love!
JEREMY
Love? !
(deep breath)
Well ... okay. The rules do in fact
make provisions for what we delude
ourselves into thinking is love.
JOHN
Oh Jesus. . . .
JEREMY
Come on! How can it be love?
You've known her for a day.
JOHN
I don't know, Jeremy. I can't
explain it. Chemical? Fate? 1
don't know. I just know!
Jeremy stares at him for a beat.
JEREMY
Fine. I understand. I'm outta
here. Good luck.
Jeremy starts to stand. John pulls him back down.
JOHN
No, no, no. You can't leave!
JEREMY
Why not?!
JOHN
Because thar'll create a huge
shitstorm with Gloria! It'll focus
the attention there! 
.- JEREMY
I don't give a baker's fuck! I had
.,my- own sweat sock duct-taped into'
my mouth last night!
(off John's look)
Long story.
JOHN
I needyou to help me. I mean what
do the rules say about abandonment?
JEREMY
(grudgingly) "Never leave a fellow crasher
stranded. Wedding crashers take
care of their own."
JOHN
That's right.
JEREMY
i hate you. . .
JOHN
Have some more toast.
JEREMY
(sighs)
I want a waffle.
JOHN
Good! That's good.
(calling out to the
cook)
Can we get this man a waffle?
John smiles and slaps Jeremy on the shoulder.
INT. SACK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Sack, looking haggard, reaches for the phone. He dials and it
rings. We cut between he and his friend TRAP MITCHELL.
EXT. MITCHELL HOUSE/INT. SACK'S ROOM - COKTINUOUS
Trap Mitchell, sipping a gin and tonic in a palatial Cape Cod
backyard,'picks up the phone.
TRAP
Hello?
SACK
Trapster, it's Sack. 
... TRAP
Sack-Master! What's the word? How
was the wedding?
SACK
It was great. Fine. Whatever.
Listen, I need background on two
guys the Secretary invited out
here for the weekend. John and
Jeremy Ryan.
Trap writes the names down.
TRAP
Okay, John and Jeremy Ryan.
SACK
They're brothers. A couple of
venture capital weasels from New
Hampshire. Got some kind of NPO
called Holy Shirts and Pants.
TRAP
Oh. ..venture capitalists, they're
the worst.
SACK
Tell my girlfriend's father. He
practically shot his cabinet level
wad over these two.
TRAP
It's ail about the money with guys
like that. Sick, sick, sick.
SACK
Preaching to the choir, brother.
TRAP
Hey, listen when you get a chance
you need to come into the firm so
we can restructure your trust fund.
SACK
Oh right, right. Will do.
TRAP
Anc! I'll look into these
guys...see what their story is
SACK
Excellent, bro. Hey listen, let's
get the guys together later on
this month. Do some sailing,
drinking, etcetera, etcetera ... 
.- TRAP
Sounds good. I'll call Skunk and
Twine.
SACK
Cool. I'm seeing Billygoat on
Tuesday so I'll tell him.
TRAP
You da ' mar..
SACK
You da' bigger man.
They laugh. They've done this before. It's nauseating.
EXT. CLEARY FAMILY DOCK - THE NEXT MORNING
John and Jeremy walk to the Cleary family sailboat. On the
side of the boat is painted "The Kathleen." Secretary and
Mrs. Cleary, Gloria, Claire, and a few other guests axe on
the boat already. Sec. Cieary is at the helm, preparing to
s2il.
SEC. CLFARY
Where's Sack?
CLAIRE
I don't know. . .
JOHN
Poor guy's probably still not
feeling well. That flu usually
lasts about two days.
SEC. CLEARY
Well, then, "The Kathleen" takes
off without him.
Sack comes ranning from the house.
SACK
Wait! I'm coming.
JOHN
Oh good. Here he comes.
(sotto, angry, to
Jeremy)
How old was that visine?!
Sack gets to the dock. We see that he's had a really rough
night. As he gets on the boat, he shoots John a dirty look. 
EXT . CLEARY-- FAMILY SAILBOAT - LATE
They're out in the ocean. Secretary Cleary is at the helm,
steering the boat. Sack sits next to Ciaire, his arm tightly
around her. John and Jeremy sit on the bow of the boat.
Gloria's arm is tightly around Jeremy.
CLAIRE
Are you all right, honey? Maybe
you should go down 'in the cabin
and iie down.
SACK
No, I'll be fine. So, John,
where'd you say you guys were from
up there in New Hampshire?
JOHN
I didn't. But we're from
Manchester.
SACK
Great town.
JOHN
Big city with a small town heart.
SACK
A college buddy of mine moved up
to Manchester.-He loves the place.
'Maybe you know him; Skunk Baker?
JOHN
Sorry. Big city. Small town heart.
But still a big city.
CLAIRE
Anyone want a beer?
Sack nods "no. "
JOHN
Sure, I'll take one.
Claire gets up and goes into the cabin of the boat.
SACK
You sure you don't know Skunk?
He's the big guy with Chase up
there. surely in your line, you've
come across each other.
Sack really doesn't look well. With each rock of the boat, he
gets a little more queasy. John notices this and gets an idea. 
.- JOHN
Hey, you know my buddy Dave's with
Chase. I bet he knows him.
(then)
Too bad Dave's not here. You'd
love him. Of course, you'd never
catch Dave on a boat again. We
went out on a boat one time and
you should have seen how sea-sick
he got. I'm telling you, it was a
mess. We'd all eaten a bunch of
Lobster Rolls and Dave likes his
just slathered in mayonnaise. I
mean he ate, like, three of them.
Sack is starting to turn green.
JOHN
(continuing)
And a bunch of corn chips. Great
guy but he eats like a sea otter.
Sack is trying not to lose his lunch.
JOHN
( continuing 1
We're not out to sea five minutes
before this guy blows like
Krakatowa. I mean, it's
everywhere. It was like reliving
the whole lunch.
Sack bolts to the cabin. As he does, he crosses Claire who's
coming back on deck with two beers.
JOHN
(continuing; to
Claire)
Poor guy. He should've stayed home.
Claire hands John a beer. He takes a sip and stares pensively
off to sea. He's trying to get her to ask him what he's
thinking about. He takes a dramatic sip of beer.
CLAIRE
Being out in tQe ocean. It makes
you realize how insignificant you
really are, huh?
JOHN
Yeah. I guess we are.
CLAIRE
No, no. I mean you. 
JOHN
very funny.
She smiles at him.
CLAIRE
Actually, that's why I hate the -
ocean.
JOHN
(looking around to
make 'sure no one's
listening)
Me too! I hite anything that comes
on like it's bigger than me.
CLAIRE
Exactly. The ocean has an attitude
and I don't like it.
(mimicking)
"I'm the ocean. I'm so vast and
eternal and you're so small and ... not eternal. "
JOHN
Which is a very nasty attitude.
(beat)
You know what else has a nasty
attitude? The stars.
CLAIRE
I know. They're rude! And the
mountains ...
JOHN
Oh, don't get me started on the
mountains.
They share a laugh then look at each other for a beat.
There's the flicker of a moment.
Sack hears John and Claire laugh and pukes into a bucket
INT. CLEARY FAMILY SAILBOAT - CONTINUOUS
John and Claire continue their conversation.
JOHN
You know what I like? Tide pools
No attitude from a tide pool. 
.. CLAIRE
There are some amazing tide pools
over on the other side of the
island. We could bike over there
this afternoon, if you like.
JOHN
I'd like that. It's a date.
SEC. CLEARY
(holding empty glass)
John, my daiquiri's swimming in
the shallow end. Take the helm.
JOHN
. ' (lying)
Sure. No problem.
SEC. CLEARY
Just start tacking back.
John, having no clue, gives Jeremy a panicked look. Zeremy
shrugs.
JOHN
Of course. Tack back. I was gonna
tack back. Excellent choice, the
tacking back.
Sec. Cleary lets go of the helm and starts for the cabin.
John grabs the wheel. Kathleen comes up behind John and grabs
his ... mast.
JOHN
(continuing)
Tacking !
John turns the wheel too quickly and the boat reacts
sudaeniy, sending the main sail flying around and smacking
into Jeremy. Jeremy flies into the ocean.
GLORIA
Jeremy!
 lo ria jumps into the water. In trying to rescue Jeremy,
Gloria is so overwrought and panicked that she keeps dunking
him back into the water. He's gasping for breath.
EXT. CLEARY FAMILY DOCK - A LITTLE LATER
The boat has docked. Everyone is disembarking. Gloria is
holding Jeremy who's wrapped in a blanket. John pulls Claire . aside. 
... JOHN
What do you say we hit those tide
pools?
CLAIRE
Sounds great.
Randolph approaches the group. He's carrying several rifles,
which he begins handing out to all the men, including John
and Jeremy.
RANDOLPH
Zverything's ready for the quail
hunt. There's a jeep waiting to
:ake ysu to the marsh.
SEC. CLEARY
Wonderful, Randolph.
JOHN
Uh, maybe, I'll sit this one out.
JEREMY
Yeah, I think we' 11 sit this one
SEC. CLEARY
Nonsense. I insist. It's a Cleary
family tradifion.
CLAIRE
(to John)
I'm afraid you're stuck. We'll
check our the tide pools later.
Sack ~akes note of this and scowls.
SEC. CLEARY
Sack, if you're too sick.. .
SACK
(determined and a
little crazed)
Oh, no. Ha ha. I'm going. Oh, I'm
going !
Sack grabs a rifle. He's starting to look a little scary.
JEREMY
(to Sack)
YOU hunt? ! 
... SACK
I hunt quail. They're
overpopulated on the island.
They're decimating the grub worm
population. Got a problem with
that? !
JEREMY
(a little frightened)
Hey, it's all good.
EXT. MARSH - A LITTLE LATER
A group of about
and Jeremy walk
stops and pulls
ten men, including Sack, Sec. Cleary, John
through the marsh looking for quail. Jeremy
John aside.
JEREMY
Have you ever shot one of these
things before?
JOHN
Oh you bet. The whole fifteen
years we've known each other?
Well, I've been sneaking out to
shoot at small birds.
(beat)
Of course I've never shot one of
these things!
3EREMY , What are we gonna do? I don't want
to kill a quail. It's bad karma.
JOHN
You'll lie to young women to get
them in bed but you won't shoot a
iittle bird?
JEREMY
Right.
JOHN
Yeah, me too. But look, j.ust aim
to miss.
'Secretary Cleary stops and points.
SEC. CLEARY
There. Off to the left.
Everyone aims.and shoots. John and Jeremy fumble to get their
.- rifle in shooting position. When it discharges, they're sent
flying five feet on their asses. 
EXT. MARSH .- A LITTLE LATER
The men are still walking through through the marsh. Jeremy
is rubbing his shoulder.
JEREMY
I thought the rifle just fired
buckshot.
JOHN
Yeah. That's ~ead pellets,
dumbfuck. It's 'not a sling-shot.
JEREMY
Thank you.
Sack stops and points.
SACK
There. Over by the spruce tree.
As everyone turns, we see Sack set his sights on John.
Through Sack's scope, we can see John's ass. The men fire.
Jeremy discharges.his rifle. He's sent reeling again. This
time into John. Sack shoots his rifle. But instead of hitting
John, he hits Ceremy. Jeremy hits the ground grabbing his ass.
JEREMY
My ass!
INT. CLEARY FAMILY BATHROOM - LATER
CLOSE ON: Jeremy's ass. Someone is pulling out buckshot with
tweezers. Pull back to reveal it's Gloria. John and Claire
poke their heads into the bathroom.
JOHN
You okay, buddy?
JEREMY
Just fucking great!
JOHN
[to Claire)
He's never been a silent sufferer.
(to Jeremy)
We're gonna take the bikes out for
a ride. We'll catch you later.
JEREMY
Yeah sure. YOU kids go and have a
good time.
(worked up)
I'll just be here getting lead
pellets pulled out of my heinie! 
John and Chire exit. CLOSE ON: Jeremy. Gloria Starts groping ,;:., L-'' . .. . ,.
Jeremy, then looks disappointed. .... . ,
GLORIA
Awww. Mr. Pogo isn't jumping up...
JEREMY '.
Well, sorry, Mr. Pogo gets
stressed whef .Mr. $&remy's
bleeding to ded'th, okay?
EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD - LATER
John and Claire are riding bikes on a path near the shore.
Sack pops into the living room. Randolph is sitting on the
couch watching TV.
SACK
Hey Randolph?
RWDOLPH
Sssh. I'm watching my stories, mon.
SACK
I just need to know where Claire
is.
RANDOLPH
Uh. ..she and that fellow went for
a bike ride to the tidepools.
Sack's jaw clenches.
EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD/TIDE POOL - LATER
John and Claire stop their bikes at the edge of a tide pool
EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD - SIMULTANEOUS
Sack pedals furiously on an ald'bike with a little basket on
the front. He Looks a lot like the mean lady in the beginning
of the Wiza~d of 02.
EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD/TIDE POOL - LATER
John and Claire exploring the tide pool.
EXT. MARTHA'S VTNEYARD - SIMULTANEOUS
. . ,, . . . Sack is still pedaling like a lunatic.' A man walks his dog
down the road. Sack rings the old-fashio'ned bike bell
aggressively and nearly runs over the man and his dog. 
EXT. MARTWS VINEYARD/TIDE POOL - LATER
John picks up a big starfish and tries to put in on Claire's
head. She splashes him. They're laughing.
Sack pullsup on his bike and watches John and Claire from
the hill above the tide pool.
John splashes her back. Soon they are in the midst of a
splashing frenzy, getting closer.to each other with each
splash. T'ney end up in each other's arms. Claire looks up at
John who's looking back at her intently.
JOHN
So, it would be a total cliche if
I kissed you right now, right?
CLAIRE
Yes. A total cliche.
She pulls him in and kisses him.
ANGLE ON: Sack vatching them.
SACK
(to himself, utterly
disgusted)
Fuck.
Sack pedals away quickly.
ANGLE ON: John and Claire. Claire breaks the kiss.
CLAIRE
I can't do this.
Ciaire runs off and gets on her bike.
INT. CLEARY FAMILY DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT
Everyone is seated.at the table mid-meal. John tries to make
eye contact with Claire but she turns away. Jeremy is
shifting cncomfortably in significant ass pain. Grandma Mary
is sound asleep, clutching a glass of sherry, snoring loudly,
Sack taps his glass for attention. Everyone stops talking and
listens.
SACK
Claire and I have an announcement
to make. We were going to wait to
tell all of you, but the spirit of
this weekend is such that we can't
th~nk .of a better time to share
our good news.
(more) 
... SACK (cont ' d)
(looking right at

Grandma Mary pops awake.
GWDPIA CLEARY
(drunk, out of it)
Is the war over?
She slumps back down. Everyone ignores her.
CLAIRE
(through gritted
teeth to Sack)
Sack...we need to talk about this.
SEC. CLEARY
Well, I am thrilled! Isn't this
wonder£ ul, Randolph?
RANDOLPH
(droll, insincere)
Oh, it's a marriage blessed by the

Claire gets up and exits outside.
INT. CLEARY FAMILY DINING ROOM - A MINUTE LATER
Some of the guests are hovering around Gloria, the rest
around Sack. John is sullen. Jeremy pulls him aside.
JEREMY
(to John)
Oh well, game over. Thanks for
playing. Maybe they'll have
parting gifts. I'll get my shit,
we'll get out of here.
John thinks for a beat, then ~akes adeep breath.
JOHN
You know what? I'm just gonna find
her and tell her the truth.
JEREMY
The truth?! Okay. That might be a
qood call. ~ou'ke the prince of
Arabia, you've rejected the
throne--
JOHN
Jeremy! The actual truth.
JEREMY
Oh. Wow. Okay.
if rustrated)
Fine. Do whatever you want. Just
do it quick, all right?
John bolts outslde. Jeremy looks out the window. From his
POV, we see John rushing after Claire. Jeremy shakes his head
and exits into the kitchen.
INT. CLEARY FAMILY KITCHEN - CONTIFJUOUS
Jeremy hobbles in, grabs a hand towel, walks to the freezer
and fills the towel with ice which he places gently on his
wounded ass. The COOK, stifles a laugh and exits.
JEREMY
(calling after her)
It's not funny! 
Jeremy sits-down on the ice pack and puts his head on the
table. Gloria walks in.
GLORIA
?here' you are!
JEREMY
,oh, hey,. Gloria.. . i
She opens a magazine in-front of his face.

JEREMY
Oh that's really nice...
GLORIA
Excellent! It's sexy and you can

She winks and exits. Jeremy moans. Father OINeil walks in and
sees Jeremy, head in hands, ass in ice.
FATHER 0' NEIL
Well, hello there.
JEREMY
Oh, hello Father.
FATHER 0' NEIL
Are you okay? You look troubled.
He sizs down next to Jeremy and pours himself a brandy.
JEREMY
Ah, you know.. .
FATHER 0' NEIL
Marriage is a big step. You sure
you're ready?
JEREMY
oh, gosh, uh, sure.. .I'm ready.
FATHER 0' NEIL
C'mon, Son. What's on your mind?
Jeremy looks out the kitchen window and sighs deeply. He's at
tne end of his rope. 
.- JEREMY
I"d like to inake a confession.
FATHER 0 ' NEIL
All right, Son. I can hear your
confession.
JEREMY
It's all confidential, right?
FATHER 0' NEIL

Oris k pace.
JOHN

So ...y outre ~marr-ying this guy, huh?
She stops and turns around.
CLAIRE
Is that what you want to know?
Well, you heard it back at the
house.
JOHN
Look, you can't marry him.
CLAIRE
Nhy not?
JOHN
Um. ..because I'm falling in love - with you.
INT. CLEARY FAMILY KITCHEN - SIMULTANEOUS
Jeremy's really comfortable with the Priest. He's kicking
back, confessing.
JEREMY
(mid sentence) ... and my bar mitzvah had a Return
of the Sedi theme which in
retrospect I regret ... but anyway,
the point is we're not venture
capitalists. We're lawyers. And we
do this, I mean we crash weddings in order to, uh.. .
FATHER 0' NEIL
Meet girls?
JEREMY
Yes, yes. Well, actually more than
meet them. We, you know, hope to
have sex with them. And, hey, if
the band's good and the spread's
decent, that's just bonus points.
FATHER 0' NEIL
And did you "meet" anybody from
the Cleary wedding?
JEREMY
Acturlly, I slept with Gloria.
Well, I didn't actually sleep with
her.
(more) 
... JEREMY (cont'd)
We did it once at the beach at the
wedding and then she...
(makes the jerk-off
motion with his hand)
... at the dinner table. There was
one more time. But I was not a
willing participant, okay?
(off Priest ' s look)
Long scory.
FATHER 0' NEIL
And your friend? With Claire?
JEREMY
No, no. Get this! He thinks he's
in love with her! Isn't that
hilarious? See? That's why we've
been here so long! Nornally we're
in and out in a couple hours and--
FP.THER C' NEIL
Okay, okay. 1 get it.
JEREMY
Did I mention Todd has a crush on
me ?
FATHER 0' NEIS
No, sadiy you left that out.
JEREMY
Oh well, he does. He pretty much
made that obvious after he gave me
a self-portrait of his testicles.
(beat )
Phew! This felt great. Thank you!
I think you guys might realiy have
something with this confession
business.
EXT. SEACH - CONTINUOUS
John is facing Claire who's looking out toward the ocean
CLAIRE
Why are you doing this to me, John?
JOHN
But, you. . .maybe feel the same way? 
-- CLAIRE
(sighs)
Maybe.
(beat)
Look I don't know anything about
you. You do investments in New
Hampshire and--
JOHN
Well,' see, that's the other thing.
We hear a loud gunshot come from the direction of the house.
CLAIRE
Oh my god!
JEREMY (O.S.)
Dude! Run!
JOHN
What the hell? !
They look back and see Jeremy being chased by Secretary
Cleary, Kathleen, Todd, Sack, and Grandma who's holding a
large shotgun firing willy-nilly at Jeremy.
GMNDMA MARY
He's a Jew!
She'fires off a round and misses. Jeremy screams.
SEC. CLEARY'
You bastards! I'm going to get you!
Jeremy catches up with John.
JEREMY
Get the fuck outta here! Run!
JOHN
What's going on?!
Jeremy continues to run.'
JEREMY

John)
I spilled! I'm sorry. The Priest
told me it was confidential!
FATHER 0' NEIL
I'm sorry. God doesn't pay the
bills. 
.- CLAIRE
Xe spilled what?!
JOHN
Oh fuck! Look, Claire, I need to
tell you some~hing quickly.
SACK
They're lawyers, Claire. Those
weren't even their real names!
GRANDMA MARY
Get back here, Jew!
Grandr~a fires off another round which barely misses John.
JOHN
(to Claire)
I'll explain later.
John runs down beach toward Jeremy.
KATHLEEN
John felt my tits!
SEC. CLEARY
Goddamit! Get 'em, Mommy!
Grandma fires another round.
SACK
They crash weddings in order to
get laid!
Claire is mortified. John turns around and looks defeatedly
at Claire.
JOHN
Claire, you don't understand!
CLAZRE
(very upset)
No, no, no. You son of a bitch!
TODD
Jeremy was going to be my lover!
(yells to 5eremy)
You're not keeping my scrotum
painting!
GLORIA
I forgive you, Jeremy! Come back! 
Grandma fires off another r0un.d as John and Jeremy tear down
the beach, over some rocks and out of sight. We see the
Cleary f arni3y sl.wwly give up the ,.chase.
EXT. FERRY - A LTTTLE LATER
John and Jeremy get on the ferry as it's taking off. In
frustration, John kicks a bench, then sits down, forlorn.
EXT./INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
Montage:
John walks dejectedly throueh the streets of Boston.
Claire walks in a similar manner along the beach on Martha's
Vineyard.
John rails a ietter addressed to Clzire.
John gets his mail. His letter' has been returned unopened
Sack shows Claire some honeymoon brochures. She smiles at tim
than stares pensively out the window.
Gloria mails a letter addressed to Jeremy.
Gloria gets her mail. Her letter has been returned unopened.
John, in a single man crew boat, is rowing frantically down
the Charles River trying to catch up to Claire who's in her
own boat. She doesn't see him. The wake from a large crew
boat pitches John's boat over, sending him flying into the
Charles.
Sack and Claire are on the beach. Sack tickles a sea otter
underneath its zhin. She puts her arm on Sack and smiles. The
sea otter bites Sack's leg.
INT. LAW FIRM OF BECKWITH AND KLEIN - THREE WEEKS LATER
John, a bounce in his step enters Jeremy's office. He's
holding the paper.
JOHN
Jeremy, I know how I can get to
her.
JEREMY
Give it up. She's returned all
your letters, she won't take your
calls. She doesn't want to see
you, all right. 
.-. JOHN
She doesn't think she wants to see
me. But.Lrusi me, she..nants tc see
me.
JEREMY
0-kay.. .
JOHN
They're having an engagement party
for her tonight at the Beach Club.
We're gonna be there.
JEREMY
We're? No.
JOHN
I need you to be my wing man.
JEREMY
Look, John, her father is the
Secretary of the Tressury. There's
qonna be Secret Service. They'll
probably have posters with our
pictures on them. There's no way
we can get in there.
JOHN
Oh yes we can.
Jeremy gives him a skeptical look.
MY. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB/ALLEYWAY - THE NEXT DAY
John and Jeremy stand at the rear of the restaurant.
JEREMY
How'd you find out about this?
John smiles and gives a coded knock on the door. RANDOLPH
opens the door.
RANDOLPH
Finally! Okay, mon, I got your
uniforms .
Jeremy stares at Randolph in disbelief
RANDOLPH
(continuing)
What are you staring at, mon?
Sack's a tool. 
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB/KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT
John and Jeremy are d~essed as waiters. John is making
coffee. The kitchen has two doors. One leads to the dining
room. The other leads to the banquet room where the Cleary's
are having the engagement party. MICHAEL, the dining room
captain walks in. Michael is clsarly gay and a bit drunk with
power.
MICHAEL
(to Jeremy)
Table five needs their soup. Muy
pronto !
JEREMY
So? They're not my table. I
haven't even started yet.
Michael is shocked at Jeremy's insolence. He struggles to
regain his composure.
MICHAEL
Okay. Who am I?
Jeremy shoots John a look.
JEREMY
You're the captain.
MICHAEL
That's right. Which makes me...?
JEREMY
(exasperated sigh)
Always right.
MICHAEL
That's right sweet-cheeks. Now get
table five their soups. Comprende?
JEREMY
Yes.
MI C.UEL
Yes, what?!
JEREMY
Yes, Captain.
Jeremy ladles two bowls of soup, puts them on a tray, and
exits into the dining room. 
.-. MICHAEL
(to John)
And you? Are we working .working or
are we, oh, just soaking in the
atmosphere?
JOHN
Yes, Captain. I'm making coffee.
That's my assignment.
MICHAEL
Like your attitude.
(beat, winks)
Let's talk later.
Michael exits inco the banquet room.
Jeremy is talking to table five, an ELDERLY COUPLE.
- JEREMY
-. rlne. i'll get you the chowder
instead.
ELDERLY MAN
The Boston chowder!
JEREMY
I know.. .
ELDERLY MAN
The white one...
XREMY
I s~id I know.. .
ELDERLY MAN
Not the red one!
JEREMY
I get it.
Jeremy picks up their soups and puts them back on his tray.
He exits back into the kitchen.
INT. CHATHAM BSACH CLUB/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Jeremy enters and puts the soups down and ladles two bowls of
chowder. He gives John the finger and exits with the chowder
into the dining room. John opens the door that leads 'io the
banquet ro0rn.a little to sneak a peek. He sees several Secret
Service guys. 
Jeremy is with table five. Their chowder is on the table.
ELDERLY WOMAN
You put ice in my water!
JEREMY
It's ice water. That's part of the
deal.
ELDERLY WOMAN
I don't want ice.
JEREMY
Okay. . .
ELDERLY WOMAN
I don't know why you put ice in my
water.
JEREMY
Because I'm not psychic?
The old woman scowls at him.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Okay, you don't want ice?
He picks up her glass and takes out the ice with his hands.
JEREMY
(continuing)
There. No ice!
ELDERLY WOMAN
(taken aback)
I'm talking to the manager!
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Jeremy enters to find John peering through the door.
JEREMY
Hurry up. Talk to her.1 can take
about five more minutes of this
shit.
JOHN
I've got to wait until she's alone.
JEREMY
It's an engagement party! Why
would she be alone?! 
.- JOHN
She's got to go to the bathroom
sometime .
Michael enters.
MICHAEL
Lester, may I have a word with you?
John nudges Jeremy.
JOHN
(sotto)
That's you.
Jeremy, remembering he's going by "Lester," walks over to
Michael.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB/BANQUET ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
JOHN'S POV: Claire and Sack are talking to some guests.
Claire looks beautiful, of course.
INT. CHATW-BEACH CLUB/DINING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Jeremy is wirh table five. His head is sunk. He's mid
apology. Michael is standing right behind him, arms folded.
JEREMY ... and again, I am deeply sorry
for my offensive words and
terrible attitude.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB/KITCHEN. - A MINUTE LATER
John peeks out the door. Suddenly he sees Claire walk toward
the restroom. He starts to go out after her, but Michael
enters and blocks his way. Claire enters the restroom.
MICHAEL
Sergio, what are we supposed to do
with cranberry torte?
JOHN
(still eyeing Claire)
What?
MICHAEL
I said what are we supposed to do
wich the cranberry torte?
JOHN
Uh ... drizzle it with Grand Marnier? 
.- MICHAEL
That's right. And what did you do?
JOHN
I drizzled it with Grand Marnier.
MICHAEL
(screeching)
You drowned it in Grand Marnler!
I nearly had to perform mouth to
mouth! The little cranberries were
in there screaming, "Oh help us!
We're drownlng in an alcohol bath!"
Claire exits the bathroom. John starts out of the kitchen.
JOHN
Excuse me, Captain. Table three
needs a. . .
We see Sack walk up to Claire and escort her back to the
Isanpet room. John1 s lost his chance.
JOGN
(continuing; to
Michael 1
I, uh, drizzle next time.. . .
MICHAEL
Please do.
Michael exits haughtily. John's sighs.
INT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB/DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jeremy walks by table five.
ELDERLY MAN
I need a soup spoon.
Jeremy stares at the table. There's a soup spoon sitting
right there. He decides not to say anything. He starts to
walk away but his pride and anger get the best of him.
JEREMY
(beside himself)
I-I-I'm sorry.
(picking up a spoon)
What's this?
ELDERLY MAN
That's not a soup spoon.
JEREMY
Well it's not a coke spoon! 
He picks upthe man's teaspoon.
JEREMY
(continuing)
See? Teaspoon, soup spoon! Tea
spoon, soup spoon! Jesus Christ!
ELDERLY MAN
Well now you've touched it! I need
another!
JEREMY
(yelling)
Get it yourself, you decrepit oldmoney cocksucker!\
The whole restaurant gasps
JEREMY
(continuing; yelling)
Does anyone else need anything?
Because I'IT gonna take my break.
Jeremy starts to exit into the kitchen. The Secret Service
guys rush into the dining room to see what the fuss is about.
Sack, Claire and Sec. Cleary are with them. They see Jeremy
who's bee-lining it for the kitchen. Gloria starts to enter
but Secretary Cleary gently pushes her back to the private
room.
SEC. CLEARY
(to Claire)
Take care of Gloria.
Claire is torn and hesitates.
SACK
Do it, sweetheart! Please!
Claire follows her sister back into the private room.
INT. CHATHiW BEACH CLgB/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Jeremy enters the kitchen.
JEREMY
(to John)
Okay. We're gonna want to run now.
John sees Sack and the Secret Service guys enter the kitchen.
JOHN
Oh not again! 
.- SACK
(to the secret
Service)
These are the guys I warned you
about.
The Secret Service, guys grab John and Jeremy.
SACK
(continuing)
'No! Let me handle it!
EXT. CHATHAM BEACH CLUB/PARKING LOT - AFEW MINUTES LATER
A guy, TRAP MITCHELL, is holding John while Sack pummels him.
The other has Jeremy pinned to the ground. Sec. Cleary looks
on.
SEC. CLEARY
Now if I see either of you
anywhere near my daughters again,
I will have you arrested! I have
that sort of power and I won't
hesitate to use it-.
Secretary Cleary storms off.
TRAP
(to Sack) . One more, Sackmaster, and then we
have to finish up dinner.
Sack slams John in the gut, spits on him and he and the Trap
go back into the restaurant, leaving John and Jeremy in the
parking lot. John sits up and rubs his jaw. Jeremy dusts
himself off. He looks at Jeremy, disgusted.
JOHN
Nice job.
JEREMY
Oh? You didn't care for my
performance as a waiter? okay,
well don't go to the fucking
sequel, all right?
John shakes his head. He takes off his torn jacket and gets
UF. So does Jeremy.
JEREMY
(continuing)
Dude, look, she's just not worth
it.
John stares at him for a beat 
.- JOHN
You know, that's what you said
, about .Mary Theresa Spinolli.
JEREMY
What? !
JOHN
Mary Theresa Spinolli? Your Junior
prom date? .- .:
JEREMY
I know the story! I had to remind
you of the story!
JOHR
Mary Theresa Spinolli was cheating
on you with every guy in high
school! You were in love with her!
She broke your heart!
JEREMY
Are you fucking high? That was
fifteen years ago!
JOHN
Mary Theresa Spinolli was your
first love and she broke your
heart! And because you had to be
a man, because we all have to be
"men," all you had to say about it
was "she's just not worth it."
JEREMY
Okay, I think you have a
concussion.
JOHN
Problem was you couldn't move on.
And since then, none of them have
been worth it ! Right, Jeremy? !
JEREMY
You're an asshole
JOHN
And now, because of that, we all
have to pay the price!
JEREMY
What price is that, John?! 
.- JOHN
Not growing up! Okay?! Pissing
away our Cucking lives living by
some idiotic dumb-ass "rules!" Not
growing up, Jeremy ...
JEREMY
You could've opted out anytime, my
friend! Nobody held a gun to your
head!
John doesn't answer.
JEREMY
(continuing)
This life.. . crashing weddings,
picking up women... this life fits
you perfectly. And you know why?
Because you're a chronic liar.
JOHN
Fuck you.
JEREMY
See, crashing weddings, pretending
to be someone you're not to get
laid? You don't do that in spite
of who you are. You do that
because of who you are! Don't get
me wrong. It's a compliment.
You're a genius at bullshit.
That's why you're so good in the
court room. And that's why you're
so good at crashing weddings. It's
who you are.
JOHN
I'm outta here.
John starts to walk away but stops and turns;
JOHN
(continuing)
All those weddings we went-to over
the years. Didn't you .once look at
how happy the bride and groom were
and wonder what that would be like?
JEREMY
NO.
JOHN
I feel sorry for you.
John starts to leave. Jeremy grabs his arm. 
.-. JEREMY
At least I know who I am,
motherfucker! You? Hell, you can
talk about love, love, love until
you're blue in the face. But in
the morning you still have to wake
up as John. Full of shit John.
John clenches his fist and is about to belt him. Then he
takes a breath, sighs and backs off.
JOHN
You know what? You're just not
worth it.
John turns and walks away.
INT. LAW FIRM OF BECKWITH AND KLEIN - TWO MONTHS LATER
Decorations and trays of food are out. Everybody's drinking.
It's a party. A banner reads: "Farewell John. Good Luck in
Chicago." We see a group of John's colleagues toast him. Joha
raises his glass and smiles. He takes a drink and casually
looks around. Jeremy's nowhere to be seen.
INT. JEREMY'S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS
Jeremy is at his desk. It's dark, save for one lone dim lamp.
Jeremy takes a drink. He's obviously unhappy.
INT. JOHN'S APARTMENT - A FEW DAYS LATER
John is packing up boxes, getting ready to move. Jeremy
bursts in.
JEREMY
Okay, don't say anything! Not a
word. Ler me just say this. What
you said outside the beach club?
It was true. I mean, about thirty
percent of it.
(off John's look)
Okay it was all true. I haven't
grown up and ... I am covering for
some ...p ain. And ... I don't know.
Look, I'm sorry I fucked up the
Claire thing for you.
JOHN
You didn't fuck up anything.
Jeremy smiles. 
... JOHN
(continuing)
Well, I mean y0.u did, but it
wasn't your fault. How could I
ever expect to woo the woman of my
dreams by crashing a wedding? It's
ridiculous.
JEREMY
Well, we did have fun...at all of
them.
JOHN
No doubt, my friend.
They look at each other and einbrace.
JOHN
(continuing)
I just need to make a new start.
Preferably in a state where I'm
not under a restraining order.
JEREMY
Yeah, I get that. It's just I was
thinking we should go out one more
time before you leave.
JOHN
Yeah. That'd be.great. What do you
want to do?
JEREMY
Well, there's a wedding ...
JOHN
Jeremy. . . .
JEREMY
Come on. For old times' sake.
JOHN
No way. I'm done with that.
J",R~.M~
This'll be thelast one! A send
off. Do it forkid. Fifteen years
of friendship ... INT. BOSTON CHURCH - LATER
John and Jeremy enter the church. They stop in the back. 
... JOHN
YOU know this is the last time I'm
doing this, right?
JEREMY
Absoluteiy.
A wedding is in progress. John iooks up at the altar. It's
Claire and Sack's wedding. He looks at Jeremy. Jeremy smiles.
JOHN
I don't think I can do this. . .
JEREMY
Sureyou can. She's the woman of
your dreams.
JOHN
Oh man....
JEREMY
It's your big moment. Dazzle the
jury.
John looks at Jeremy.
JOHN
Thanks .
JEREMY
You'll want to hurry up. I think
they're getting pretty close to
the "I do" part. Which would be
bad.
John walks toward the altar. He clears his throat loudly. All
eyes turn to him.
JOHN
Excuse me.
SEC. CLEARY
Oh, for the love of God!
He motions security over. Grandma Cleary stands up.
GRANDMA CLEIbRY
It's the Jews!
SACK
Security!
The Secret Service approach John. 
.- JOHN
Just let me speak my mind and I'll
Leave -you all- alone- forever.
Sec. Cleary nods "okay" to the security men.
SACK
(sotto to Claire)
I don't fucking believe this.
JOHN . ,
Claire, it's true, I met you
because I crashed your sister's
wedding.
(to the guests)
That's right. I crash weddings. Or
at least I used to. In fact.. . (pointing to a couple)
I crashed your wedding about a
year ago. Very nice, by the way.
I will say a vegetarian option is
usually a good idea but,
otherwise, a wonderful wedding.
How's it going for you by the way?
They nod "pretty good." From the back of the church, Jeremy
clears his throat as if to say, "Pick it up."
JOHN
(continuing)
And, yes, it's true I'm a lawyer.
But my heart's not in my law
practice. I mean, I've tried to do
good. Well, that hasn't always
been true and, well, I've lied...
a lot.
Everybody shifts uncomfortably. Jeremy clears his throat
again.
JOHN
(continuing)
All right, all right! My point is
I've changed. I guess I've grown
up and I don't know why it took me
so long but, well, maybe it's
because I didn't see anything
worth growing up for and now maybe
I do and look, I don't know ... I'm
sorry. I'm usually pretty
articulate but... I guess it's a
lot harder when you're not
bullshitting.
(to the Priest)
Sorry Father. 
Father O'Ndl nods "don't worry about it."
JOHN
( continuing)
Yes, I was a liar. I was a liar
because I was scared. But you know
what, Claire? You're scared too.
You're scared to tell the truth
about Sack. You're not in love
with that bozo.
Sack turns crimson.
SACK
Okay, I 've had enough.
He starts to moves off the altar. Claire holds his arm.
JOHN
In fact, I think you might be in
love with me. I know I'm in love
with you. In fact, I love every
single thing about you ... except
for the fact you're on that altarwith another man.
John starts to walk toward the altar.
JOHN
(continuing)
But, Claire, I've made a change in
my life because of you and maybe
you'd like to make a change
because of me.
Claire looks at Sack and then looks at John. A long beat and
then she smiles at Sack. She leans to him. He smiles. We
think she's going to kiss him. Their lips are about to meet.
CLAIRE
I'm sorry, Sack.
She takes off her veil and steps off the altar. Sack looks at
Secretary Cleary as i f t o say "help me."
SEC. CLEARY
Claire !
Claire turns around.
SEC. CLEARY
(continuing; beat,
then smiling)
I'm sure you and John will be very
happy. At least try to be, okay? 
.- SACK
Oh, you've got to be kidding!
SEC. CLEARY
Lodge, you're a tool. In fact, you
come from a long line of tools. I
suppose youlre maintaining the
tool tradition...but not with my
daughter.
Sack glares at Sec. Cleary, then bolts off the altar. He's
running straight for John but before he can get there, Jeremy
runs up from the back of the church and tackles him.
JEREMY
(to Sack)
Oh sorry, dude, I don't know what
got into me. I'm seeing a Buddhist
about it.
Claire runs up and hugs John. They begin rushing out of the
church.
JOHN
Tianks , buddy.
JEREHY
My pieasure.
Gloria's noticed Jeremy for =he first time.
GLORIA
Jeremy !
She runs toward him.
Todd stands up, runs toward a man in the first row and hugs
him.
TODD
Senator Frankel!
There's total chaos in the church. John and Claire kiss. They
run out of the church.
EXT. CHURCH STEPS - CONTINUOUS
John and Claire look at each other and smile.
JOHN
Where to?
CLAIRE
1'~~ starving.. . 
.- JOHN
Me too. What're you in the mood
for?
We see Jeremy being chased by Gloria, ten feet behind them.
CLAIRE
I don't know. Maybe Japanese.
JEREMY
(calling out)
Fujimora wedding! Salem. Three
p.m. Great tempura.
Jeremy keeps running. John and Claire shake their.heads and
laugh. A wedding guest who's late, walks up with a gift in
her hand and perplexedly hands it to Claire.
CLAIRE
(to John)
Place setting.
JOHN
Oh yeah.
She hands the gift back. John and Claire look at each other,
kiss and keep running.
DISSOLVE TO:
CHYRON READS: ONE YEAR LATER
PNT. HOUSE OF WORSHIP - ONE YEAR LATER
CLOSE ON: John and Jeremy. They're in tuxes. We see just a
touch of the altar behind them. The Wedding March begins to
play. John's a little nervous. They have a sotto conversation.
JEREMY
Dude, you ready for this?
JOHN
Yeah, yeah ... of course.
JEREMY
Because you seem nervous...
JOHN
I'm fine, I'm fine.
(beat)
It's just that I've never been a
Best Man before.
We pull back to see Gloria walking down the aisle with
Secretary Cleary. 
... JEREMY
Dude, you're going to be a groom
next month!
We see Claire, the Maid of Honor standing with other
bridesmaids. John smiles at her. She smiles back.
JOHN - Oh, that I can deal with. Watching
you do this, different story.
Jeremy laughs. Gloria gets closer.
JEREMY
You know, we're going to be
brothers-in-law.
JOHN
I know.
JEREMY
Well, you know, the rules for
brothers-in-law are different.
When Chazz Reinghold got married,
he said--
JOHN
Wait! What do you mean "When Chazz
Reinghold got married?! " You never
told me he actually got married!
Gloria's-nearly at the altar.
JEREMY
(sheepish)
Oh ...y eah ... well he tied the knot
last year.
JOHN
I can't believe you dLdnft tell me
that?!
JEREMY
I guess I forgot ...
JOHN
Bullshit.
CLAIRE
(sotto)
Boys! Enough!
JOHN
(to Jeremy)
We'll talk about this later. 
Secretary Cleary gives Gloria a kiss and shakes Jeremy's
hand. Jeremy beams as he sees Gloria, radiant. John smiles
and pats Jeremy or, the back. Jeremy starts.to.ward the altar
where we see a Priest and a Rabbi.'
JEREMY
(to himself)
Shoot! I forgot.
Jeremy takes out a yarmulkeand puts it on.
CLOSE ON: Grandma Mary. She rolls her eyes.
As Jeremy is about to step up to the altar he turns to John.
JOHN
(whispering)
Dude, row seven, five and six
seats in.
John turns around. He sees two guys in their early twenties.
They're both gently dabbing their eyes. John turns toward
Jeremy and smiies.
JOHN
(continuing; sotto)
Crashers.
JEREMY
Oh yeah.
John chuckles and gives the guys a nod. Jeremy walks up to
the altar. He and Gloria smile at each other, as we:
FADE OUT:
THE END
